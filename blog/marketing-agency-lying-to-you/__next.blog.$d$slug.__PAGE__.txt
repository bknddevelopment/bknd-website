4:T1c5f,<p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Last month, a contractor I know showed me his marketing report. He'd been paying $3,000 a month for "digital marketing services" for eight months. That's $24,000.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I asked him a simple question: "How many leads did this generate?"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">He didn't know. The reports talked about impressions, reach, engagement rates. Lots of colorful graphs. Not a single mention of phone calls, form submissions, or actual customers. When he asked his agency directly, they sent him a longer PDF. Still no answer.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This isn't an isolated case. It's the damn industry standard.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Red Flag #1: Vanity Metrics</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here's what a typical agency report looks like:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">50,000 impressions</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">12,000 reach</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">3.2% engagement rate</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"Strong brand visibility"</li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here's what that same report should say:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">50,000 impressions</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">0 phone calls</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">0 form submissions</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">$0 in value</strong></li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Impressions" means your ad loaded on someone's screen. They probably didn't see it. They definitely didn't care. Engagement rate? Someone scrolled past your post slightly slower than the others.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">None of this matters if it doesn't turn into business. A report without lead counts, cost per lead, and conversion rates is a report designed to hide failure. If your agency can't tell you how many customers they brought in last month, they're either incompetent or hoping you won't ask.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Red Flag #2: The "Brand Building" Excuse</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">When you press an agency for real numbers, they'll often retreat to "brand awareness."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"We're building your brand. You can't measure that directly. It takes time to see results."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is cover for having nothing to show. Real brand building has milestones. After 3 months, direct search traffic should increase. After 6 months, you should see branded keyword growth. These are measurable.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If your agency talks about brand awareness without specific timelines and metrics, they're hoping you'll keep paying while they figure out what they're doing. Real agencies set expectations: "By month three, we expect X. If we don't hit it, here's what we'll change."</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Red Flag #3: Data Hostages</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Ask your agency for login access to your Google Analytics. Your Google Ads account. Your Facebook Business Manager.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If they hesitate, that's a problem. If they say "we manage that for you," that's a bigger problem.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">You should own everything.</strong> Your analytics, your ad accounts, your domain, your hosting. All of it. An agency that sets up accounts in their name is holding your data hostage. When you leave, you lose your history, your audiences, your everything.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">We set up every account in our clients' names on day one. Full admin access. If you fire us tomorrow, you walk away with everything we built. That's how it should work.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Red Flag #4: The Escape Tax</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Watch out for:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"Setup fees" that mysteriously equal one month's payment</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"Ramp-up periods" where results don't count</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">6-12 month contracts with early termination penalties</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Vague language about "campaign momentum" if you consider leaving</li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These are designed to trap you. If an agency is confident in their work, they don't need to lock you in. Good results keep clients around. Contracts keep hostages around.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">We work month-to-month. No setup fees. No termination penalties. Every month, we have to earn your business again. That's how it should be.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">What to Demand Instead</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before signing with any agency—including us—ask these five questions:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">1. "Can I see my Google Analytics in real time?"</strong>
You should have your own login. If they won't give it to you, walk away.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">2. "How many leads or calls did we get last month?"</strong>
An actual number. Not impressions. Not reach. Leads.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">3. "What's my cost per lead?"</strong>
Total spend divided by total leads. If they can't answer this, they're not tracking properly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">4. "Do I own all my accounts and data?"</strong>
Google Ads, Facebook, Analytics, Search Console—all should be in your name.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">5. "What happens if I cancel next month?"</strong>
The answer should be: "You keep everything, we part ways." Anything else is a red flag.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Why We Built BKND This Way</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I'm a developer by trade. Spent years building software where everything is measured, tested, and accountable. Every feature either works or it doesn't. You can't hide behind "brand awareness" when the code doesn't compile.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I got tired of watching businesses waste money on marketing that couldn't prove its value. So I built an agency that treats clients like adults. We show you the real numbers. We give you full ownership. We earn your business every single month.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If that sounds refreshing, we should talk. If you like the mystery, there are plenty of other agencies happy to take your $3,000.</p>0:{"buildId":"wJBxWt2M6B9aM3vWRh2lZ","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"children":["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-24 pb-24 lg:pt-32 lg:pb-32 bg-white","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sg","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[720px] mx-auto","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-[#86868B] text-sm mb-6","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"January 25, 2026"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"·"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"5 min read"}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-[32px] lg:text-[48px] font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] tracking-[-0.02em] leading-[1.1] mb-6","children":"Your Marketing Agency is Lying to You"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-[#86868B]","children":["By ","Charwin Vanryck deGroot"]}]]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"delay":0.15,"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$4"}}]}],"$L5"]}]}]}]}],"$L6"],["$L7","$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
