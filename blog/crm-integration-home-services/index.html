CRM, marketing automation, call tracking, landing pages, email, SMS, review requests, pipeline management.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The integration advantage: everything is native. No Zapier. No middleware. Build a workflow that captures a lead, sends a text, waits for response, assigns a task, and triggers a review request after the job. All in one place.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The disadvantage: steep learning curve. The interface is not intuitive.

- Caller phone number
- Call timestamp
- Call duration
- Call recording (for quality and training)
- Traffic source that drove the call
- Landing page they were on before calling
- Keyword they searched (if from paid search)</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Platform-specific integration patterns:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">CallRail to Go High Level:</strong>

Use Zapier. Trigger on "call completed," action creates Jobber customer with notes containing call details.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">CallRail to HubSpot:</strong>
Native integration available. Calls create timeline events and can trigger workflows.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">CallTrackingMetrics to any CRM:</strong>
Webhook notifications on call events. Configure to POST to your CRM API or Zapier webhook.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The configuration that matters most: ensuring the tracking source follows the call. Dynamic number insertion on your website captures the visitor's original traffic source (Google Ads, organic, Facebook, etc.) and attaches it to the call.

      </div><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 1: Not Capturing Source Data</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Leads flow into the CRM but without attribution. You know you got 100 leads this month but not which marketing produced them.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: audit your form and call tracking configurations. Every contact entry point needs to capture and pass source data.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 2: Overwriting Data on Updates</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A contact fills out two forms. The second submission overwrites the original source data. Now you think they came from organic when they actually came from a $50 Google Ads click.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: configure integrations to preserve original source data. Update additional fields but never overwrite attribution fields on existing contacts.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 3: Duplicate Contacts</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Same person enters the system multiple times through different channels. You now have three contacts for John Smith with fragmented data.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: use phone or email as the unique identifier. Configure integrations to update existing contacts rather than create new ones when a match exists.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 4: No Error Handling</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Webhook fails. Zapier errors out. Integration breaks. Nobody notices for two weeks. Leads are lost.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: set up monitoring. Zapier has error notifications. Webhooks can log to a monitoring service. Check integration health weekly.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 5: Over-Engineering</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Building 47 Zaps before you have a basic system working. Adding complexity before you have proven the simple version works.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: start with one integration. Website forms to CRM. Get that bulletproof. Then add call tracking. Then add closed-loop reporting. Layer complexity gradually.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">The Integration Stack I Recommend</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For most contractors doing $500K-$3M revenue, here is the integration stack that balances power and simplicity:</p><div class="my-8 p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-[#00D4FF]/10 to-[#00D4FF]/5 border-l-4 border-[#00D4FF] rounded-r-lg">
