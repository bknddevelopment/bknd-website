18:T6188,<p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I've managed Google Ads accounts for contractors where $2,000 a month generated 40 qualified leads. I've also audited accounts spending $5,000 a month on clicks that never converted.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The difference isn't budget. It's setup.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google Ads for contractors is a different game than running ads for e-commerce or SaaS. You're targeting a local service area. Your customers are high-intent but skeptical. And phone calls matter more than form fills.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This guide covers everything from campaign structure to bidding strategy. No theory. Just what generates jobs.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Why Google Ads Works Differently for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Standard Google Ads advice assumes you're selling nationally, competing on brand, and optimizing for online conversions. None of that applies to contractors.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Geography defines everything.</strong> Your service area is fixed. A roofer in Austin doesn't care about clicks from Houston. You need geographic precision that most advertisers don't think about.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Intent is immediate.</strong> Someone searching "emergency plumber" needs help now. Someone searching "roof replacement austin" is getting quotes this week. The buying cycle is compressed, which means your ads need to connect to a phone call fast.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Phone calls beat form fills.</strong> A homeowner with a broken AC isn't filling out a contact form. They're calling. Your campaigns need to be optimized for calls, not just clicks.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Trust barriers are high.</strong> You're asking someone to let strangers into their home and write a $5,000 to $15,000 check. Your ads and landing pages need to build credibility instantly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These constraints shape everything that follows.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Campaign Structure for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most contractors either lump everything into one campaign or create an overcomplicated structure they can't manage. Here's what actually works.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Search Campaigns vs. Local Service Ads</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Start with Local Service Ads (LSAs) if you haven't already. LSAs appear above standard search ads, include a Google Guarantee badge, and operate on a pay-per-lead model. You only pay when someone actually contacts you.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For contractors, LSAs typically outperform standard search ads on cost per lead. Max out your LSA budget before expanding to search campaigns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Standard search campaigns fill the gaps LSAs don't cover. Long-tail keywords, branded searches, and specific service combinations often get better coverage through search.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Campaign Organization by Service Type</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Separate campaigns by service category. This gives you independent budgets and bidding for each service line.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For an HVAC contractor:
- Campaign 1: AC Repair (high volume, emergency)
- Campaign 2: AC Installation (high value, longer cycle)
- Campaign 3: Heating Services (seasonal)
- Campaign 4: Maintenance Plans (lower intent)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For a roofing company:
- Campaign 1: Roof Repair (emergency, high intent)
- Campaign 2: Roof Replacement (high value)
- Campaign 3: Storm Damage (insurance work)
- Campaign 4: Commercial Roofing (different audience)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Each campaign gets its own budget, so your emergency repair ads don't compete with your replacement campaigns for daily spend.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Within each campaign, create ad groups around specific keyword themes. "AC repair" and "AC not working" go in different ad groups with different ads tailored to each search intent.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Keyword Strategy</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Keywords make or break contractor campaigns. The wrong keywords burn budget on clicks that never convert.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">High-Intent Keywords That Convert</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These keywords indicate someone ready to hire:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Emergency and immediate need:</strong>
- emergency [service] + [city]
- [service] near me
- 24 hour [service]
- same day [service]</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Service-specific with location:</strong>
- [service] company + [city]
- [service] contractor + [city]
- best [service] in + [city]</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Price and quote oriented:</strong>
- [service] cost
- [service] estimate
- [service] quote
- how much does [service] cost</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For a plumber in Denver, high-intent keywords look like: "emergency plumber denver", "plumber near me", "water heater repair denver", "plumber cost denver".</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These keywords cost more per click but convert at 3-5x the rate of informational keywords.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Negative Keywords List</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is where most contractors hemorrhage money. Without negative keywords, Google will show your ads for searches that will never convert.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Add these immediately:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Employment seekers: jobs, careers, hiring, employment, salary, apprentice, license requirements, training, certification</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">DIY searchers: DIY, how to, tutorial, youtube, self, myself, own</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Supply seekers: supply, supplies, wholesale, parts, materials, depot, lowes, home depot</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Non-customers: free, cheap, complaints, lawsuit, scam, reviews (sometimes), images, pictures, videos</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Competitors researching: franchise, start a business, marketing, software</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Wrong services: If you're a plumber, add HVAC, electrical, roofing, and other trades you don't do.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Review your Search Terms report weekly. Add any irrelevant searches as negatives. A well-maintained negative keyword list can cut wasted spend by 30-40%.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Match Types for Contractors</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Exact match</strong> for your core high-intent keywords. [emergency plumber denver] only shows for that specific search or very close variants.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Phrase match</strong> for service + location combinations. "plumber in denver" captures "licensed plumber in denver" and "affordable plumber in denver."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Broad match with caution.</strong> Google's broad match has improved with smart bidding, but for contractors it still pulls in too much irrelevant traffic. If you use broad match, pair it with a robust negative keyword list and monitor search terms daily.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Start with exact and phrase match only. Add broad match later if you need more volume and have the tracking to measure quality.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Bidding Strategies</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Bidding determines how much you pay for each click and how Google prioritizes your ads. Wrong bidding wastes money. Right bidding scales profitably.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Manual CPC vs. Automated Bidding</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Manual CPC</strong> gives you direct control over max bids. Good for: new accounts without conversion data, testing new keywords, tight budget control.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Set manual bids based on estimated conversion value. If your average job is $3,000 and you close 10% of leads, each lead is worth $300. If you convert 5% of clicks to leads, each click is worth $15. Bid below that to maintain margin.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Maximize Conversions</strong> tells Google to get as many conversions as possible within your budget. Requires conversion tracking to be set up correctly. Good once you have 30+ conversions per month per campaign.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Target CPA</strong> (cost per acquisition) sets a target cost per conversion and lets Google optimize toward it. Best for mature campaigns with consistent conversion data. Set your target CPA at 20-30% below your maximum acceptable cost to give Google room to optimize.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Target ROAS</strong> (return on ad spend) optimizes for conversion value, not just volume. Requires conversion value tracking, which most contractors don't have set up properly. Skip this unless you're feeding closed job revenue back to Google.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Bid Adjustments That Matter</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Location adjustments.</strong> Increase bids in your most profitable service areas. Decrease in areas with lower close rates or longer drive times. A +20% bid adjustment for your core city and -30% for fringe areas focuses spend where it performs.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Device adjustments.</strong> For contractors, mobile typically outperforms desktop. Emergency searches happen on phones. Consider +15-25% mobile bid adjustments for emergency services.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Time-of-day adjustments.</strong> If your office closes at 5pm and you can't answer calls, lower bids after hours. If you offer 24/7 emergency service, increase bids overnight when competition drops.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Ad schedule.</strong> Some contractors see lower quality leads on weekends. Test reducing weekend bids by 15-20% and measure if lead quality improves.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Budget Allocation</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Budget determines your reach. Too little and you can't learn what works. Too much too fast and you waste money on unoptimized campaigns.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Starting Budgets by Business Size</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Solo operator or small team (1-5 trucks):</strong> $1,500-3,000/month
Start with LSAs at $50-75/day. Add one search campaign for your highest-value service at $30-50/day. Focus on exact match keywords for your core service area.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Mid-size company (5-15 trucks):</strong> $3,000-7,000/month
LSAs maxed out. 2-3 search campaigns covering primary services. $50-100/day per campaign. Enough volume to test and optimize.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Larger operations (15+ trucks):</strong> $7,000-15,000+/month
Full campaign structure across service lines. Geographic expansion campaigns. Competitor conquesting. Enough data for automated bidding to work effectively.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These are starting points. Scale based on performance, not arbitrary targets.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Seasonal Adjustments</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Contractor demand fluctuates. Your budget should too.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">HVAC:</strong> Peak summer (AC) and winter (heating). Increase budgets 30-50% during peak seasons. Reduce in shoulder months.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Roofing:</strong> Spring through fall in most markets. Storm seasons spike unpredictably. Keep budget flexible to capture storm demand.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Plumbing:</strong> More consistent year-round, with winter spikes for frozen pipes and water heater failures.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Don't maintain the same budget year-round if your demand is seasonal. You'll overspend when demand is low and underspend when it's high.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">When to Scale</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Scale budget when:
- Your cost per lead is below your target threshold
- You're capturing less than 50% impression share on converting keywords
- You have capacity for more jobs</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Don't scale when:
- You can't handle more leads (answer rate drops, follow-up slows)
- Cost per lead is at or above your threshold
- You haven't optimized current campaigns</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Scaling bad campaigns just loses money faster. Optimize first, then scale.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Ad Copy That Converts</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your ad copy is the first impression. It determines whether someone clicks or scrolls past.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Headlines That Work</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google now uses responsive search ads. You provide up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions. Google tests combinations.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Effective headline formulas:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Service + Location: "Roof Repair in Austin"

These ads show only on mobile and clicking calls you directly. No landing page in between.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Call-only ads work well for:
- Emergency plumbing
- AC repair in summer
- Furnace repair in winter
- Lockouts</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The trade-off: no landing page means no pre-qualification. You may get more calls but lower quality. Test against standard mobile ads.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Landing Pages for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your landing page determines whether clicks become leads. A bad landing page kills even the best campaigns.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">What to Include</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Above the fold:</strong>
- Headline matching the search intent
- Phone number (click-to-call on mobile)
- Clear call-to-action button
- Trust signals (reviews, certifications, years in business)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Below the fold:</strong>
- Service description matching the ad
- Before/after photos of your work
- Pricing guidance (ranges are fine)
- Process explanation (what happens when they call)
- Full testimonials
- FAQ section</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">What not to include:</strong>
- Navigation to other pages (keeps them focused)
- Stock photos (customers can tell)
- Walls of text (nobody reads them)
- Multiple competing CTAs</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mobile Optimization</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Over 70% of contractor searches happen on mobile. Your landing page must work perfectly on phones.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Requirements:</strong>
- Page loads in under 3 seconds
- Phone number tappable at the top
- Form fields are large enough to tap
- Buttons are thumb-sized
- No horizontal scrolling
- Images compressed for fast loading</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Test your landing pages on your own phone. If anything frustrates you, fix it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Build dedicated landing pages for each major campaign. Don't send all traffic to your homepage. An ad for "emergency roof repair" should go to a page about emergency roof repair, not a generic roofing services page.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Tracking and Optimization</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Running Google Ads without proper tracking is gambling. You need to know which keywords, ads, and campaigns generate actual customers.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Conversion Tracking Setup</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Track these actions:
- Phone calls from ads (use Google forwarding numbers or call tracking)
- Phone calls from website (requires call tracking software)
- Form submissions (Google Ads conversion tracking or Google Analytics)
- Chat initiations if you use live chat</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Set up conversion tracking in Google Ads, not just Google Analytics. Google Ads needs this data to optimize bidding.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Call tracking implementation:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Use CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. These services provide tracking numbers that record which marketing source generated each call.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Dynamic number insertion shows different tracking numbers to visitors from different sources. Visitors from Google Ads see one number. Visitors from Facebook see another. Organic visitors see another.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This tells you exactly which campaigns and keywords generate calls, not just clicks.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Call Tracking Integration</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Connect your call tracking to Google Ads. This allows:
- Call conversions to feed back to Google for optimization
- Call duration filtering (only count calls over 60 seconds as conversions)
- Keyword-level call attribution</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A 15-second call is usually a wrong number or tire kicker. A 3-minute call is a real lead. Track call duration and set minimum thresholds for what counts as a conversion.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Key Metrics to Monitor</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Weekly checks:</strong>
- Cost per conversion (should stay below your threshold)
- Search terms report (add negatives for irrelevant terms)
- Impression share (are you losing to budget or rank?)
- Quality scores (below 5 needs attention)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Monthly analysis:</strong>
- Conversion rate by campaign
- Cost per lead trend over time
- Device performance comparison
- Geographic performance
- Day and hour performance</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Quarterly review:</strong>
- Overall ROI calculation
- Campaign structure adjustments
- Budget reallocation based on performance
- Seasonal adjustment planning</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">The Reality Check</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><a href="/services/paid-advertising" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Google Ads for contractors</a> works. But it requires ongoing attention. This isn't set-and-forget marketing.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Budget reality: Expect to spend $2,000-5,000 to learn what works before you're profitable. Consider the first month or two as data gathering.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Time reality: Managing Google Ads properly takes 3-5 hours per week. If you're not willing to invest that time, hire someone who will.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Results reality: Well-managed contractor campaigns generate leads at $30-100 each depending on your market and service. Close 20-30% of those leads and the math works out. If your close rate is low, the problem might not be your ads.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The contractors who succeed with Google Ads treat it as a system. They track everything. They optimize continuously. They connect ad spend to actual jobs closed, not just leads generated.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you want help setting this up right the first time, <a href="/services/paid-advertising" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">we build these systems</a> for contractors. Full tracking, proper campaign structure, ongoing optimization. You'll know exactly which keywords generate which jobs.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">But if you're doing it yourself, this guide is the playbook. Follow it step by step, track your results, and optimize based on data. That's how you turn Google Ads from a budget drain into a lead machine.</p>e:[["$","$L16",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"children":["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-24 pb-24 lg:pt-32 lg:pb-32 bg-white","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sg","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[720px] mx-auto","children":[["$","$L17",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-[#86868B] text-sm mb-6","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"January 25, 2026"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"·"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"15 min read"}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-[32px] lg:text-[48px] font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] tracking-[-0.02em] leading-[1.1] mb-6","children":"Google Ads for Contractors: Budget, Bidding, and Best Practices"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-[#86868B]","children":["By ","Charwin Vanryck deGroot"]}]]}]}],["$","$L17",null,{"delay":0.15,"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$18"}}]}],"$L19"]}]}]}]}],"$L1a"]
