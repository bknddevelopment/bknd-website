At some point, the math breaks.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A plumbing company gets 50 new leads per week. Each lead needs a follow-up call within 5 minutes to maximize conversion. Then a text. Then an email sequence. Then appointment reminders. Then a review request after the job.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">That is 250+ touchpoints per week just for new leads. Add in quote follow-ups, past customer reactivation, and seasonal campaigns, and you are looking at a full-time job that nobody is doing.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is why leads slip through cracks. Why reviews do not get requested. Why customers who called once never hear from you again.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Automation fixes this. Not by replacing human interaction, but by handling the repetitive sequences so your team can focus on conversations that matter.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Why Most Service Businesses Fail at Automation</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I have seen two failure modes repeatedly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The first: buying expensive software and using 10% of it. A company pays $500/month for a platform with 200 features. They set up basic email sequences. Everything else sits untouched because nobody knows how to configure it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The second: cobbling together free tools that do not talk to each other. Gmail plus Google Calendar plus some random SMS app. Nothing syncs. Data lives in five places. Leads fall through gaps between systems.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix is not more software. It is a coherent system designed around your actual workflow, built to handle the specific sequences that generate revenue for service businesses.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">The $200/Month Automation Stack</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You do not need enterprise software. You need the right tools connected properly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here is the stack I recommend for most service businesses doing $500K-$5M in revenue.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Option 1: Go High Level ($97-297/month)</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is the all-in-one option. CRM, email, SMS, call tracking, landing pages, review requests, and automation workflows in one platform.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The advantage: everything talks to everything else natively. No integration headaches. Build a workflow that triggers when a lead comes in, sends a text, waits 2 minutes, sends an email, waits 1 day, assigns a follow-up task. All in one place.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The disadvantage: the interface is not pretty. There is a learning curve. Some features feel half-baked compared to dedicated tools.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Best for: companies that want one platform to rule everything and are willing to invest time learning it.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Option 2: Industry-Specific CRM + Integrations</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For general contractors and home services:</strong> Jobber ($49-199/month) or Housecall Pro ($49-149/month)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These platforms are built for field service businesses. Scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, and customer management designed for how you actually work.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Automation is more limited than Go High Level, but the core workflows exist: appointment reminders, follow-up emails, review requests.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For HVAC specifically:</strong> ServiceTitan (enterprise pricing) if you are doing $2M+. Overkill for smaller operations.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For roofers and exterior contractors:</strong> JobNimbus ($25-150/month) or AccuLynx (varies) both handle the estimate-to-close workflow well.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Adding What Industry CRMs Lack</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Industry-specific CRMs handle scheduling and jobs well. They usually lack sophisticated marketing automation. Fill the gaps with:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Email marketing:</strong> Mailchimp ($13/month for 500 contacts) or ConvertKit ($15/month). These handle drip sequences, segmentation, and email deliverability better than most CRMs.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">SMS marketing:</strong> SimpleTexting ($29/month) or Textline ($59/month). Two-way texting, automation triggers, and compliance handling.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Integration glue:</strong> Zapier ($19.99/month) or Make ($9/month) connects everything. When a job is marked complete in Jobber, trigger a review request in SimpleTexting. When a form is submitted on your website, create a contact in your CRM and start an email sequence.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Total cost with this approach: $150-250/month depending on contact volume and which tools you choose.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">The Five Essential Automations</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">I have built dozens of automation systems for service businesses. These five sequences generate the most ROI.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">1. Speed-to-Lead Follow-Up</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is the most important automation you will build. Research shows that responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you 21 times more likely to qualify them compared to waiting 30 minutes.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most service businesses respond in hours. Some respond in days. Many never respond at all.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here is the sequence that works:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Minute 0:</strong> Lead comes in (form submission, phone call, or ad).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Minute 1:</strong> Automated text message. "Hi [Name], this is [Company]. We got your request for [service]. What is the best time to discuss?"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Minute 2:</strong> Automated email with more detail. Include your phone number, brief company intro, and what to expect next.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Minute 3:</strong> Internal notification to your team. Slack message, email alert, or CRM task assignment. Someone needs to call this lead now.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Minute 15:</strong> If no response to the text, send a follow-up. "Just wanted to make sure you got my message. We typically respond within a few hours."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Hour 1:</strong> If still no response, another touchpoint. This one can be a voicemail drop if your system supports it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 1, 3, 7:</strong> Continued email sequence with value-add content relevant to their inquiry. Not "just checking in" messages. Actual information about the service they requested.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This sequence runs automatically for every single lead. No manual intervention required until someone responds.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">2. Review Request Automation</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You need reviews. You will not remember to ask for them consistently. Automate it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Trigger:</strong> Job marked complete in your CRM.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Timing:</strong> Wait 2-4 hours. Long enough for them to experience the work, short enough that satisfaction is still fresh.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Channel:</strong> Text message first. Email as backup.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Message:</strong> "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing [Company] for your [service]. If you were happy with our work, would you take 30 seconds to leave us a Google review? [direct link]"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">That direct link matters. Do not send them to Google and make them search for you. Generate a direct review link from your Google Business Profile.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For more detail on making <a href="/services/analytics" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">analytics and tracking work together</a>, including review attribution, that guide covers the technical setup.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Follow-up:</strong> If no review after 3 days, send one more message. After that, stop. Do not badger people.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Some businesses segment this: only send review requests to customers who rated their experience 4+ stars in a post-job survey. This protects against negative reviews while still generating volume.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">3. Appointment Reminders</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">No-shows cost money. Every missed appointment is lost revenue plus wasted drive time.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">24 hours before:</strong> Text and email reminder with appointment details. Include what to expect, how to prepare, and a clear way to reschedule.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">2 hours before:</strong> Quick text reminder. "We will see you at 2pm today. Reply C to confirm or R to reschedule."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">On the way:</strong> "Our technician is on the way and will arrive in approximately 30 minutes."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This sequence reduces no-shows by 30-50% in my experience. It also reduces "I forgot" phone calls that waste your office staff's time.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">4. Quote Follow-Up Sequence</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You give an estimate. The customer says they need to think about it. Then silence.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most contractors follow up once, maybe twice, then give up. The customer goes with whoever was most persistent.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here is a better approach:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 1 after estimate:</strong> Thank you email with estimate summary and answers to common questions.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 3:</strong> Text message checking in. "Hi [Name], wanted to see if you had any questions about the estimate we sent. Happy to clarify anything."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 7:</strong> Email with additional value. Could be a case study, financing options, or warranty information relevant to their project.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 14:</strong> Phone call (human, not automated) if the lead is qualified and the job is worth it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Day 30:</strong> Final email. "Your estimate for [project] is still valid. If you decide to move forward, we would love to help."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The key insight: most estimates are not lost on day one. They are lost in the follow-up desert between day 3 and day 14. Automation keeps you present during that decision window.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">5. Past Customer Reactivation</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your best leads are people who already hired you once. They know you. They trust you. They just need a reminder.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For HVAC and seasonal services:</strong> Automated maintenance reminders.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Hi [Name], it has been 6 months since we serviced your AC. Most systems need annual maintenance to stay efficient. Want to schedule your tune-up? [booking link]"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For one-time services (roofing, remodeling):</strong> Periodic check-ins with referral asks.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Hi [Name], we installed your roof 2 years ago. How is it holding up? If you know anyone who needs roofing work, we would appreciate the referral. We offer $X for successful referrals."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">For all services:</strong> Annual holiday or seasonal touchpoint. Not a sales pitch. Just staying top of mind.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Happy holidays from [Company]. Thanks for being a customer. If you need anything in the new year, we are here."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is not aggressive. It is maintenance. One or two touchpoints per year keeps you in their memory when they need you again or when a friend asks for a recommendation.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Lead Follow-Up Automation: The Deep Dive</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Let me break down the speed-to-lead sequence in more detail because this is where most service businesses lose the most money.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Channels</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">SMS is king for immediate response.</strong> 98% of text messages are read within 3 minutes. Email sits unread for hours. Phone calls go to voicemail. Text gets through.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Email handles detail and documentation.</strong> Attach estimates, share links, provide information that does not fit in a text.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Phone remains critical for closing.</strong> Automation gets them engaged. A human closes the deal.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Workflow Architecture</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here is how I structure the workflow in Go High Level (similar logic applies in other platforms):</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Trigger:</strong> New contact created from any source (web form, Facebook lead ad, manual entry, phone call transcription).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 1:</strong> Wait 1 minute.

Please call us back at your earliest convenience."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">That reads like a robot wrote it.

What's the best time to call you today?"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Personal. Specific. Asks a concrete question.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For email, the same principle applies. Do not write corporate-speak. Write like a human who wants to help solve their problem.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Review Generation That Scales</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Let me expand on the review automation because <a href="/blog/hvac-marketing" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">HVAC marketing</a> and other service industries live and die by their review count.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Technical Setup</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 1:</strong> Create a Google review direct link. Go to your Google Business Profile, click "Ask for reviews," and copy that link. Or construct it manually: https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=[YOUR_PLACE_ID]</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 2:</strong> Set up the trigger in your CRM. "Job status changed to Complete" or "Invoice marked Paid" both work.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 3:</strong> Add a delay. I use 2-4 hours for most services. For emergency services where relief is immediate, 1 hour can work.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 4:</strong> Send the text. Keep it short. Include the link. Make it easy.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Step 5:</strong> Send backup email 24 hours later if no review detected. (Some platforms can detect when a review is posted and stop the sequence.)</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Handling Negative Experiences</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The last thing you want is to automate asking an unhappy customer for a review.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Two approaches:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Post-job survey first:</strong> Before asking for a review, send a one-question survey. "How would you rate your experience? 1-5 stars." Only trigger the review request for 4-5 star responses. Route 1-3 star responses to a manager for personal outreach.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Technician feedback:</strong> Let your technician flag difficult jobs or unhappy customers. If flagged, skip the automated review request.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Either approach is better than blindly asking everyone.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Seasonal Campaign Automation</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><a href="/blog/home-services-marketing-guide" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Home services marketing</a> is inherently seasonal. HVAC has summer and winter peaks. Roofing follows storm seasons. Landscaping follows growing seasons.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Manual campaign management means scrambling every season transition. Automation means campaigns run themselves.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Spring HVAC Example</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">January 15:</strong> Segment your list for "Residential AC customers."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">February 1:</strong> First email. "Spring is coming. When did you last service your AC? Schedule your tune-up before the rush." Include early-bird pricing if you offer it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">February 15:</strong> SMS to non-openers. Same message, different channel.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">March 1:</strong> Second email with urgency. "Our March schedule is 40% booked. Lock in your tune-up time now."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">March 15:</strong> Final push to remaining non-booked customers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This runs every year automatically. Adjust the content once, and the sequence handles itself.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Storm Season for Roofers</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Trigger:</strong> Weather alert in your service area. (Some automation platforms integrate with weather APIs.)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Immediate response:</strong> Email and SMS to your customer list. "Severe weather expected in [area]. If you experience any damage, we're here to help. Save our number: [phone]."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Post-storm (48 hours later):</strong> "The storm has passed. We're offering free inspections this week for any homeowners concerned about damage. [Booking link]."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This positions you as responsive and helpful while generating legitimate leads.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Integration: Making Systems Talk</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Stand-alone tools are useless if they do not share data. This is where <a href="/services/analytics" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">proper analytics setup</a> separates professionals from amateurs.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Integration Stack</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Zapier or Make:</strong> These no-code platforms connect almost anything. They work on a trigger-action model.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Example: When a new contact is created in Jobber (trigger), add them to a Mailchimp audience (action), send a welcome email (action), and add a row to a Google Sheet for reporting (action).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Native integrations:</strong> Many platforms now connect directly. Go High Level integrates with Facebook Lead Ads natively. Housecall Pro connects to QuickBooks. Check what your tools already support before adding middleware.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Webhooks for custom connections:</strong> If you have a developer (or access to one), webhooks handle anything Zapier cannot. Your website form can POST data directly to your CRM. Your CRM can notify your analytics platform when a job closes.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Common Integration Patterns</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Lead capture to CRM:</strong> Website form submits to your CRM, creating a contact and triggering the speed-to-lead sequence.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">CRM to email platform:</strong> New contacts sync to your email marketing tool for newsletter and campaign sends.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Job completion to review request:</strong> Closed job triggers the review automation sequence.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Call tracking to CRM:</strong> Inbound calls create or update contact records with call recordings attached.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">CRM to analytics:</strong> Closed revenue data passes back to Google Analytics and ad platforms for accurate ROI tracking.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This last one is critical. Without it, you optimize for leads. With it, you optimize for actual revenue.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Measuring Automation ROI</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Do not set up automation and forget it. Measure what matters.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Metrics to Track</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Speed to lead:</strong> Average time from lead submission to first touchpoint. Target: under 5 minutes.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Response rate:</strong> Percentage of leads who reply to automated sequences. Benchmark: 15-25% for SMS, 5-10% for email.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Review request conversion:</strong> Percentage of completed jobs that result in reviews. Benchmark: 10-20%.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Reactivation revenue:</strong> Revenue generated from past customer campaigns. Track this separately from new customer revenue.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Automation-influenced deals:</strong> Deals where automated touchpoints occurred before human conversion. This shows automation's contribution to pipeline.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Reporting Setup</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Create a monthly automation report with:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Total leads processed through automation</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Average response time</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Lead-to-appointment rate</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Reviews generated</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Reactivation campaign revenue</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Any automation failures or errors</li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This report takes 30 minutes to build once and 10 minutes to review monthly. It is how you know your system is working.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">After building automation for dozens of service businesses, I see the same mistakes repeatedly.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 1: Over-Automation</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Sending 15 emails in 7 days does not make you persistent. It makes you spam.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: Map your sequence to actual customer decision timelines. Emergency services need fast, intense follow-up. Major purchases need patient, value-based nurturing.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 2: Generic Messages</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Just following up" and "wanted to touch base" signal that you have nothing to say.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: Every automated message should provide value or ask a specific question. If you cannot justify why a message exists, delete it.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 3: No Human Handoff</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Automation warms leads. Humans close deals. If your sequence has no point where a human takes over, you will lose conversions.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: Build clear triggers for human intervention. Hot lead indicators (replied, clicked multiple emails, high-value service) should notify your team immediately.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 4: Set and Forget</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Automation is not a crockpot. You cannot set it and walk away forever.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: Monthly review of metrics and message performance. Quarterly updates to copy and sequences. Annual overhaul to align with business changes.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Mistake 5: Ignoring Compliance</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">SMS marketing has legal requirements. TCPA violations can cost $500-1,500 per message.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The fix: Get explicit opt-in before texting. Include opt-out instructions. Honor unsubscribes immediately. When in doubt, consult a lawyer.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Getting Started</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You do not need to build everything at once. Start with the highest-impact automation and expand from there.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Week 1:</strong> Set up speed-to-lead sequence. This is where the most money leaks.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Week 2:</strong> Implement review request automation. Takes an hour, runs forever.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Week 3:</strong> Build appointment reminder sequence. Reduces no-shows immediately.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Week 4:</strong> Create quote follow-up workflow. Recovers lost estimates.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Month 2:</strong> Add past customer reactivation and seasonal campaigns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Each automation you add compounds on the others.
