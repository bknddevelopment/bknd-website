4:T822f,<p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Roofing is one of the hardest businesses to market. Not because it's complicated, but because most marketing advice doesn't account for what makes roofing different.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You're selling something invisible until there's a problem. Your customers don't think about you until water is dripping through their ceiling or a hailstorm just passed through. And when they do need you, they're calling three other companies too.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This guide covers 15 strategies that actually work for roofing companies. No theory. Just what generates leads and closes jobs.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Why Roofing Marketing Is Different</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard marketing advice fails for roofers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Seasonality runs everything.</strong> Spring storms create a surge. Winter kills lead flow in most markets. You can't just "run consistent campaigns" and expect consistent results. Your marketing has to flex with demand.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Storm chasing changed the game.</strong> After major storms, out-of-town crews flood your market. They're knocking doors, running aggressive ads, and competing for the same insurance jobs. You need a strategy that builds local trust faster than they can.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">High ticket means high skepticism.</strong> A $12,000 roof replacement isn't an impulse buy. Homeowners research, compare, and worry about getting scammed. Your marketing needs to build trust before they'll even pick up the phone.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Insurance work adds complexity.</strong> Many roofing jobs involve insurance claims. Your marketing needs to speak to both direct-pay customers and storm damage victims navigating insurance processes. Different audiences, different messages.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Now for the strategies.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">1. Google Business Profile Domination</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your Google Business Profile is the single most important marketing asset you own. When someone searches "roofer near me" or "roof repair [city]", the map pack results get more clicks than anything else.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most roofers set up their profile and forget it. That's a mistake.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Complete every field.</strong> Services, service areas, hours, attributes. Google rewards completeness. Takes 30 minutes.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Add photos weekly.</strong> Before and after shots of actual jobs. Crew photos. Truck photos. Not stock images. Google's algorithm can identify generic stock photos, and so can customers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Post updates weekly.</strong> Nobody reads them, but posting signals to Google that you're an active business. We've tested profiles with weekly posts against identical profiles without. The posting profiles rank higher.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Optimize Q&A.</strong> Add your own questions and answers. "Do you handle insurance claims?" "Yes, we work directly with all major insurance providers for storm damage claims." Free keyword optimization that competitors ignore.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Categories matter.</strong> "Roofing Contractor" as your primary category. Add "Roof Inspection Service" and "Gutter Installation Service" as secondary categories if you offer those services.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This alone can put you in the map pack for high-intent local searches. Free leads, recurring monthly.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">2. Local SEO for "[City] Roofing Contractor"</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Beyond your Google Business Profile, you need your website ranking for local searches. This means <a href="/services/seo" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">building out location and service pages</a> that target specific keywords.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Every city you serve needs its own page. "Roofing Contractor Austin" is different from "Roofing Contractor Round Rock." These pages need:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Unique content.</strong> Not the same page with the city name swapped. Write about that specific area. Mention neighborhoods. Reference local landmarks. Google knows the difference between unique content and find-replace.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Testimonials from that area.</strong> If you have reviews from Round Rock customers, feature them on the Round Rock page.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">NAP consistency.</strong> Your name, address, and phone number must match exactly across your website, Google Business Profile, and every directory you're listed on. "123 Main St" and "123 Main Street" are different to Google.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Schema markup.</strong> LocalBusiness structured data on every location page. This tells Google explicitly that you serve that area. Your developer can implement this in under an hour.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For a roofing company serving 8-10 cities, building out proper location pages can generate 50+ additional organic leads per month. It's tedious work, but the compound returns are significant.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">3. Google Ads for Roofing</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><a href="/services/paid-advertising" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Google Ads</a> for roofing is expensive. CPCs for "roof replacement" can hit $30-50 in competitive markets. But done right, it's also the highest-intent traffic you can buy.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Start with exact match keywords.</strong> Broad match for roofing is a budget incinerator. Google will happily spend your money on "roofing jobs" (employment seekers), "DIY roof repair" (not hiring anyone), and "roofing materials near me" (contractors, not customers).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Build a negative keyword list immediately.</strong> Add: jobs, employment, career, DIY, how to, supply, supplies, materials, wholesale, contractor license, training. Review your search terms report weekly and add more.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Keyword structure that works:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">High intent (bid aggressively):
- roof replacement + [city]
- emergency roof repair
- storm damage roof repair
- roofing company near me</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Medium intent (bid moderately):
- roof inspection + [city]
- roof leak repair
- new roof cost</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Low intent (bid conservatively or skip):
- best roofing materials
- how long does a roof last
- signs you need a new roof</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Budget reality:</strong> In most markets, you need $2,000-5,000/month to test Google Ads properly. Below that, you don't have enough data to optimize. If your budget is under $2,000, focus on Local Service Ads and SEO instead.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Landing pages matter.</strong> Don't send paid traffic to your homepage. Build dedicated landing pages for each service. Roof replacement ads go to a roof replacement page with specific pricing information, photos, and a single clear call-to-action.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">4. Local Service Ads: The Roofing Advantage</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Local Service Ads (LSAs) should be your first paid investment. Unlike standard Google Ads, you only pay when someone actually contacts you.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For roofing companies, LSAs have two major advantages.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Trust signals are built in.</strong> The Google Guaranteed badge means Google has verified your insurance, licensing, and background checks. This immediately differentiates you from storm chasers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Pay-per-lead, not pay-per-click.</strong> You're not paying for tire-kickers who clicked an ad and bounced. You're paying for phone calls and messages from people who want to hire a roofer.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Getting the most from LSAs:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Response time affects your ranking. Answer calls immediately. Return messages within minutes. Google tracks this.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Reviews heavily influence LSA rankings. More Google reviews with higher ratings means more LSA visibility. This compounds with your organic GBP efforts.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Set your budget by leads, not dollars. Calculate what you can afford to pay per lead based on your close rate and average job value. A $50 lead that closes 20% of the time at $10,000 average job value is wildly profitable.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The limitation: LSA inventory is limited. You can't just spend more to get more leads like traditional ads. But max out LSAs before investing heavily in standard Google Ads.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">5. Review Generation That Actually Works</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Reviews are currency in roofing. They affect your Google rankings, your LSA positioning, and whether a prospect calls you or your competitor.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The mistake most roofers make: they ask for reviews months after the job, if at all.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">The right timing:</strong> Request the review the same day the job completes, while the customer is still happy about their new roof. Not a week later when they've moved on mentally.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">The right method:</strong> Text, not email. A text with a direct link to your Google review page gets 10x the response rate of email. Keep it short: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us for your roof. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">The right volume:</strong> Aim for 5-10 new reviews per month. Consistent review velocity signals to Google that you're an active, legitimate business.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Responding to reviews:</strong> Every single one. Positive reviews get a quick thank you. Negative reviews get a professional response that acknowledges the issue and offers resolution. Future customers read your responses as carefully as the reviews themselves.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Never offer incentives for reviews.</strong> It's against Google's terms, it looks sketchy, and one customer calling you out for it destroys your credibility. The ask alone is enough if you've done good work.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">6. A Website That Actually Converts</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your website's job is to convert visitors into phone calls. Everything else is secondary.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most roofing websites fail at this. They're slow. They bury contact information. They look like every other roofing site with the same stock photos.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What converts for roofing:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before and after galleries. Real photos of actual jobs you've completed. This is the single most persuasive element on a roofing website. Customers want to see your work, not stock photos of generic roofs.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Financing information upfront. A $12,000 roof is a lot of money. If you offer financing, say so prominently. "$89/month with approved credit" converts better than hiding financing options on a separate page.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Clear pricing guidance. You don't need exact quotes, but ranges help. "Typical roof replacement in [city]: $8,000-$15,000 depending on size and materials." This qualifies leads and builds trust through transparency.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Phone number visible everywhere. Sticky header with click-to-call on mobile. Phone number on every page. Make it impossible to miss.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Fast load times. Over 70% of searches happen on mobile. If your site takes 5 seconds to load on a phone, half your visitors are gone before they see anything.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Trust signals throughout. Licensing info, insurance badges, manufacturer certifications, years in business, BBB rating. These should be visible on every page, not buried on an about page.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A <a href="/services/cro" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">properly optimized roofing website</a> can double your conversion rate from the same traffic. That's twice the leads for zero additional ad spend.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">7. Storm Damage Content Strategy</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Storm damage is where roofing marketing gets seasonal. After a major hail event or windstorm, search volume spikes dramatically. Homeowners need help fast.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Create content before the storms hit:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"What to do after a hailstorm damages your roof" - Step by step guide
"How to file a roof insurance claim in [state]" - Insurance process walkthrough
"Signs of storm damage on your roof" - Visual guide with photos
"Storm damage roof repair vs replacement" - Decision framework</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This content ranks before the storm. When the storm hits, you're already on page one while competitors scramble.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Storm-specific landing pages:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">After major events, create dedicated pages. "May 2026 Austin Hailstorm Roof Damage" with:
- Date and affected areas
- What homeowners should do
- Your inspection availability
- Insurance claim assistance info</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These pages capture hyperlocal, time-sensitive search intent.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Social proof from storm work:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Document your storm response. How many roofs did you replace after the last major storm? Customer testimonials specifically about insurance claim assistance. This builds credibility for the next event.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">8. Facebook and Instagram for Roofing</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Social media for roofing isn't about virality. Nobody shares roofing content. It's about staying visible to people in your service area and retargeting website visitors.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What works on Facebook:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before and after transformations. These perform well visually. Split image showing the destroyed roof next to the beautiful new installation.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Time-lapse project videos. Condense a 3-day job into a 30-second video. People find this surprisingly satisfying to watch.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Team content. Crew photos, company events, community involvement. This humanizes your business against faceless competitors.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Customer testimonial videos. A 30-second clip of a happy customer is more persuasive than any written testimonial.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Facebook Ads strategy:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Retargeting first. Someone visited your website but didn't call? Show them testimonial ads for the next 30 days. This is cheap and effective.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Lookalike audiences second. Upload your customer list and target people who match their demographics and behaviors.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Skip broad awareness campaigns. The ROI rarely works for local service businesses.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Budget: $500-1,500/month for retargeting and lookalikes is usually sufficient.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">9. Nextdoor Marketing</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Nextdoor is underutilized by most contractors. It's a hyperlocal platform where neighbors recommend service providers to each other.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Claim your business page.</strong> This is free. Complete your profile, add photos, respond to recommendations.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Encourage customers to recommend you on Nextdoor specifically.</strong> After a job, ask: "If you know anyone in the neighborhood who needs roofing work, we'd appreciate a mention on Nextdoor."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Run local deals.</strong> Nextdoor allows local businesses to promote offers to specific neighborhoods. A "Free roof inspection for [Neighborhood Name] residents" drives leads directly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Monitor neighborhood posts.</strong> When someone asks "Can anyone recommend a roofer?", you want to be the one they're recommending. This requires having done good work in that neighborhood already.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">10. Referral Programs That Work</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Word of mouth is still the best marketing. The question is whether you're actively cultivating it or just hoping it happens.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Structure that works for roofing:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">$200-500 referral bonus for customers who refer someone that closes. Cash or gift card, their choice. Make it meaningful enough to remember.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Inform customers during the job. Not after. "If you know anyone else who needs roofing work, we offer a $300 referral bonus." Plant the seed while you're top of mind.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Follow up specifically about referrals. Two weeks after job completion, send a text: "Enjoying your new roof? If any neighbors need work, here's our referral link: [tracking link]"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Track referrals rigorously. Know exactly which customers sent which referrals and pay promptly. A delayed bonus kills future referrals.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Referral cards work too.</strong> Leave physical cards with customers. "Give this to a friend" with a code that tracks back to them. Old school, but effective.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">11. Door-to-Door Plus Digital Follow-Up</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Door knocking isn't dead for roofing. It's especially effective after storms when homeowners are actively looking for help.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Modern door-to-door:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Leave behind more than a card. A one-page handout with: your company info, what to look for on their roof, QR code to your website, and a special offer for that neighborhood.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Capture information, not just appointments. If they're not ready, get their email or phone number for follow-up. "Can I send you information about what to look for with your roof type?"</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Digital follow-up sequence:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Same day: Text message thanking them for their time, with your contact info.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Day 2: Email with educational content about their roof type or local weather concerns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Day 5: Second text offering a free inspection.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Day 10: Final email with a time-sensitive offer.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This sequence converts people who weren't ready on the doorstep into appointments later. The door knock starts the relationship. The digital follow-up closes it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">12. Video Marketing</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Video builds trust faster than any other medium. For roofing, it's especially powerful because customers rarely see what actually happens on a job.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Drone footage.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Show completed roof jobs from above. This perspective is stunning and showcases your work in a way photos can't. One drone and a $1,500 investment can create content that differentiates you for years.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before and after drone shots are particularly effective. Show the damaged roof, then the completed installation.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Process videos.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Walk through what happens during a roof replacement. What materials do you use? How does your crew operate? What safety measures do you take? This demystifies the process and builds confidence.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Inspection videos.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Record your inspections (with permission). Show homeowners the actual damage you found. This transparent approach builds trust and reduces skepticism about your recommendations.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Post videos everywhere:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">YouTube (for SEO), Facebook, Instagram, your website. A single video can serve multiple platforms.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">13. Email Marketing for Past Customers</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your past customers are your warmest leads for referrals and repeat business. But most roofers never email them again.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What to send:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Quarterly maintenance tips. "5 things to check on your roof this spring." Genuinely helpful content keeps you top of mind.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Annual anniversary emails. "It's been a year since we installed your roof. Here's what to look for." Subtle reminder that you exist.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Storm alerts. "Major storm headed toward [city]. Here's how to prepare your roof." Shows you're proactive and caring.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Referral reminders. Twice a year, remind them about your referral program.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Keep the list clean.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Remove bounces, update addresses, honor unsubscribes. A healthy email list has higher engagement and better deliverability.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Tools: Mailchimp's free tier handles most roofing company needs. Move to ConvertKit or ActiveCampaign if you need more automation.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">14. Direct Mail for Targeted Neighborhoods</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Direct mail isn't dead. For roofing, it works when targeted properly.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Where it works:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Neighborhoods with aging roofs. Use property data to identify homes built 15-20+ years ago. Their roofs are approaching replacement age.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Storm-affected areas. After a major weather event, blanket affected zip codes with storm damage information.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Recent move-ins. New homeowners often need roof inspections. Target homes that sold in the last 6 months.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What to send:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Not generic postcards. Educational content with clear next steps. "Free Guide: Is Your Roof Storm-Ready?" with a QR code to download it from your website (capturing their email).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Lumpy mail for high-value targets. A dimensional package to a homeowner with a 25-year-old roof in an affluent neighborhood gets opened. Cost per piece is higher, but so is response rate.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Track rigorously.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Unique phone numbers or landing pages for each campaign. Know exactly which mailers generate calls.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">15. Strategic Partnerships</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Other professionals regularly interact with homeowners who need roof work. Partner with them.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Real estate agents.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Roofs kill deals. Agents need reliable roofers who can inspect quickly and provide honest assessments. Become their go-to recommendation. Offer same-day inspections for transactions. They'll send you consistent referral traffic.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Insurance adjusters.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Build relationships with local independent adjusters. They can't officially recommend you, but they can mention that "other homeowners in your situation have worked with..." You become the name they mention.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Home inspectors.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Home inspectors find roof issues. They can't do the work themselves. Be the company they recommend. Offer them a referral fee or just ensure their clients have a great experience.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Other contractors.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Siding companies, gutter installers, solar installers. You encounter the same customers. Cross-refer when it makes sense.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">How to build these relationships:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Lunch meetings. Buy them lunch, learn their business, explain how you can help their clients. Do this monthly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Joint marketing. Co-host an educational seminar with a real estate agent. "Home Maintenance for New Homeowners."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Reciprocate. When you encounter clients who need their services, send them referrals. Relationships work both ways.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Budget Allocation by Business Size</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">How should you allocate marketing spend? It depends on where you are.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Under $500k/year revenue:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Focus on free channels first. Google Business Profile optimization, review generation, referral program, basic website fixes. Paid budget of $1,000-2,000/month max, focused entirely on LSAs.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">$500k-1.5M revenue:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Max out LSAs. Add $2,000-4,000/month Google Ads budget. Start systematic local SEO. Allocate $500-1,000/month for Facebook retargeting. Total marketing budget: 8-10% of revenue.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">$1.5M+ revenue:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Full-channel approach. LSAs maxed. Google Ads optimized. Facebook running. <a href="/blog/home-services-marketing-guide" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Content marketing</a> for SEO. Video production. Direct mail for targeting. Email nurturing. Partnership development. Total marketing budget: 10-15% of revenue.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Measuring ROI: Cost Per Lead vs Cost Per Job</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Stop looking at cost per click. Start looking at metrics that matter.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What to track:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Cost per lead (CPL): Total marketing spend divided by total leads. For roofing, target $50-150 per lead depending on market.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Cost per estimate (CPE): Marketing spend divided by scheduled estimates. This filters out unqualified leads.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Cost per job (CPJ): The real number. Marketing spend divided by closed jobs. For a company with 25% close rate, a $100 CPL becomes $400 CPJ.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Return on marketing investment: Revenue from marketing-attributed jobs divided by marketing spend. Target 5:1 minimum. 10:1 is excellent.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">How to track:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Call tracking is mandatory. Use CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. Assign unique tracking numbers to each marketing channel.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">CRM attribution. Your CRM should capture lead source for every contact. When the job closes, you know which marketing generated it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Monthly reporting. Create a simple spreadsheet tracking leads, estimates, and closed jobs by source. Update weekly, review monthly, adjust quarterly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Without this tracking, you're guessing which marketing works. And guessing with a $10,000/month marketing budget is expensive.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">What Actually Matters</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Roofing marketing isn't rocket science, but it does require understanding what makes roofing different from other businesses.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The companies that dominate their markets do a few things well: they show up when people search, they have overwhelming social proof, they respond faster than competitors, and they track everything.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The companies that struggle try a little of everything, track nothing, and can't tell you which marketing actually generates jobs.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Pick the strategies from this list that match your budget and capacity. Execute them well. Track the results. Double down on what works.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you want help building out these systems properly, implementing tracking that actually works, or running <a href="/services/paid-advertising" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">paid advertising that generates measurable ROI</a>, we work with roofing companies. <a href="/contact" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Reach out</a> and we'll audit what you're currently doing.</p>0:{"buildId":"1wpHDVTTJHLDgzSnC2cN-","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"children":["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-24 pb-24 lg:pt-32 lg:pb-32 bg-white","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sg","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[720px] mx-auto","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-[#86868B] text-sm mb-6","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"January 25, 2026"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"·"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"15 min read"}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-[32px] lg:text-[48px] font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] tracking-[-0.02em] leading-[1.1] mb-6","children":"Roofing Company Marketing: 15 Strategies That Generate Leads"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-[#86868B]","children":["By ","Charwin Vanryck deGroot"]}]]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"delay":0.15,"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$4"}}]}],"$L5"]}]}]}]}],"$L6"],["$L7","$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
