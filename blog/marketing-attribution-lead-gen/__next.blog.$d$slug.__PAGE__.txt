"Google" and "google" create separate buckets in your reports. Pick lowercase and stick with it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Create a documented convention.</strong> Write down your UTM structure. Share it with anyone who creates marketing links. Consistency matters more than perfection.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Don't use UTMs for internal links.</strong> UTMs on internal links overwrite the original source attribution. Someone arrives via Google Ads, clicks an internal link with UTMs, and now they show as coming from your internal campaign.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Use a spreadsheet or URL builder.</strong> Manual UTM creation leads to typos and inconsistency. Google's Campaign URL Builder works for basic needs. A shared spreadsheet with formulas works for teams.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Example naming convention:
```
utm_source: platform name (google, facebook, yelp, email)
utm_medium: channel type (cpc, organic, social, referral, email)
utm_campaign: descriptive-name-with-date (spring-promo-2026-q2)
```</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Auto-Tagging vs Manual UTMs</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google Ads can auto-tag clicks with a gclid parameter. This provides more accurate tracking than manual UTMs and enables features like audience building.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Recommendation:</strong> Use auto-tagging for Google Ads. Use manual UTMs for everything else.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you need both (rare), enable "Allow manual tagging to override auto-tagging" in GA4.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Offline Conversion Tracking</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is where lead gen attribution gets real. Tracking website activity is easy. Tracking closed revenue is hard.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">

When you tell Google Ads that a click from February resulted in a $15,000 job in April, the algorithm gets smarter about which clicks lead to valuable customers.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Setup requirements:</p><ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Enable offline conversion tracking in Google Ads</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Capture gclid on all form submissions</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Store gclid in your CRM at lead creation</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Export closed leads with gclid, conversion date, and value</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Upload via CSV, Google Sheets sync, or API</li></ol><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Upload timing matters.</strong> Google recommends uploading offline conversions within 90 days of the click.

You know both produce leads. Does it matter precisely whether Google Ads is 60% of revenue or 70%? You're not going to stop doing SEO either way.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Attribution precision becomes valuable when you're making meaningful reallocation decisions. If your budget is small and your channels are few, directional accuracy is sufficient.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Brand Searches</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Someone searches your company name and calls you. What gets the credit?</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Technically, branded search gets last-touch credit. But branded search didn't create demand. It captured demand that something else created.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Don't optimize for branded search attribution. Optimize for the non-branded channels that drive people to search your brand name in the first place.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Referrals and Word-of-Mouth</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your best customer source might be impossible to track. A neighbor recommends you. A family member vouches for your work. Someone sees your truck in a driveway.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These touchpoints will never show up in your attribution model. The customer will arrive as "direct traffic" or maybe a branded search if they google you before calling.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Accept that some of your business comes from unmeasurable sources. That doesn't mean you shouldn't measure what you can.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Attribution Reporting</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Data without reporting is useless.

</p>
      </blockquote><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Every model makes assumptions. Every tracking system has gaps. Every customer journey includes unmeasurable touchpoints.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A customer might see your yard sign, google you later, read reviews, see a retargeting ad, call from a different phone, and book an appointment. Your tracking might capture two of those five touchpoints if you're lucky.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">That's okay.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The goal isn't perfect attribution. The goal is attribution that's accurate enough to make better decisions than you're making today.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you currently have no idea which channels produce customers, basic tracking gives you massive improvement. If you're already tracking sources, connecting offline conversions gives you the next improvement. If you're already doing that, multi-touch models might refine things further.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Diminishing returns hit fast. Going from 0% tracking to 60% tracking is transformative. Going from 80% tracking to 85% tracking rarely changes decisions.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">What Actually Matters</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For most lead gen businesses, here's what moves the needle:</p><ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Track phone calls.</strong> Most of your conversions happen on the phone. <a href="/blog/call-tracking-setup-guide" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">Set up call tracking</a> or stay blind.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Connect your CRM.</strong> Attribution to closed revenue beats attribution to leads.
