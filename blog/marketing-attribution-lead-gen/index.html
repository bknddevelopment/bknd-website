When someone calls your office and books an appointment, the transaction happens outside your tracking system entirely.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">That phone call is your conversion event. But Google Analytics doesn't know about it. Google Ads doesn't know about it.

A study by Invoca found that 68% of consumers prefer to contact businesses by phone for urgent issues.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">But phone calls are attribution black holes.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">When someone calls the number on your website, you don't automatically know:
- Which marketing channel brought them to your site

Someone sees an ad and buys within the same week, often the same session.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Lead gen attribution windows are measured in weeks or months. A roofing job might have a three-month journey from first touch to closed contract. A kitchen remodel could take six months from initial research to deposit.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Standard attribution windows don't accommodate this. Google Ads' default conversion window is 30 days. If your sales cycle is 45 days, you're systematically underreporting conversions for every channel.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Worse, the longer the journey, the more touchpoints exist, and the more complex the attribution question becomes.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Attribution Models Explained</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">An attribution model is a rule that determines how credit for conversions gets distributed across touchpoints.

### The "Good Enough" Model</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For most lead gen businesses, last-touch with call tracking is good enough.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Credit the conversion to whatever channel immediately preceded the form submission or phone call. Don't overthink the awareness touchpoints you can't measure anyway.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Is this perfect? No. You're probably undervaluing awareness channels like SEO and over-crediting channels like branded search.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Does it work? Yes. You can make meaningful optimization decisions. You know whether Google Ads is producing leads. You know if your SEO investment is generating calls. You have data instead of guesses.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Perfect attribution is a fantasy.

The default model is data-driven, but it falls back to paid-and-organic last-click for accounts without enough conversion data.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Key settings to configure:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Attribution settings:</strong> Admin > Attribution settings. Set your lookback window to match your sales cycle. For home services, 60-90 days is usually appropriate.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Reporting attribution model:</strong> Set your default reporting model.

- utm_source

- utm_campaign
- utm_content (optional)
- gclid (Google Click ID, if present)
- Referring URL</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most CRMs support this through hidden form fields. HubSpot does this automatically.

They're also the most commonly screwed-up part of attribution tracking.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">The Five UTM Parameters</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">utm_source:</strong> The specific platform. "google", "facebook", "yelp", "direct_mail"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">utm_medium:</strong> The marketing channel type. "cpc", "organic", "referral", "email"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">utm_campaign:</strong> The specific campaign. "spring_ac_promo", "roof_replacement_2026", "brand_awareness"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">utm_content:</strong> Differentiates similar links. "ad_variant_a", "homepage_hero", "footer_link"</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">utm_term:</strong> The keyword (primarily for paid search). Auto-populated by Google Ads with auto-tagging enabled.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">UTM Best Practices</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Use lowercase consistently.</strong> UTMs are case-sensitive. "Google" and "google" create separate buckets in your reports. Pick lowercase and stick with it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Create a documented convention.</strong> Write down your UTM structure. Share it with anyone who creates marketing links. Consistency matters more than perfection.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Don't use UTMs for internal links.</strong> UTMs on internal links overwrite the original source attribution. Someone arrives via Google Ads, clicks an internal link with UTMs, and now they show as coming from your internal campaign.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Use a spreadsheet or URL builder.</strong> Manual UTM creation leads to typos and inconsistency. Google's Campaign URL Builder works for basic needs. A shared spreadsheet with formulas works for teams.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Example naming convention:
```
utm_source: platform name (google, facebook, yelp, email)
utm_medium: channel type (cpc, organic, social, referral, email)
utm_campaign: descriptive-name-with-date (spring-promo-2026-q2)
```</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Auto-Tagging vs Manual UTMs</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google Ads can auto-tag clicks with a gclid parameter. This provides more accurate tracking than manual UTMs and enables features like audience building.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Recommendation:</strong> Use auto-tagging for Google Ads. Use manual UTMs for everything else.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you need both (rare), enable "Allow manual tagging to override auto-tagging" in GA4.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Offline Conversion Tracking</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is where lead gen attribution gets real.

You know both produce leads. Does it matter precisely whether Google Ads is 60% of revenue or 70%? You're not going to stop doing SEO either way.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Attribution precision becomes valuable when you're making meaningful reallocation decisions. If your budget is small and your channels are few, directional accuracy is sufficient.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Brand Searches</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Someone searches your company name and calls you. What gets the credit?</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Technically, branded search gets last-touch credit. But branded search didn't create demand. It captured demand that something else created.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Don't optimize for branded search attribution. Optimize for the non-branded channels that drive people to search your brand name in the first place.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Referrals and Word-of-Mouth</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your best customer source might be impossible to track. A neighbor recommends you. A family member vouches for your work. Someone sees your truck in a driveway.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">These touchpoints will never show up in your attribution model. The customer will arrive as "direct traffic" or maybe a branded search if they google you before calling.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Accept that some of your business comes from unmeasurable sources.
