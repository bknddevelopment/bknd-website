The truck reaches maybe 200 people a day. Google reaches everyone in their service area actively searching for what they sell.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Local SEO for contractors isn't the same as local SEO for restaurants or retail stores. You don't have a storefront customers walk into. You serve a geographic area, not a point on a map. Your trust signals matter more because you're asking people to let strangers into their homes.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This guide covers what actually works for service area businesses in 2026. Not theory. Not "best practices" copied from articles about coffee shops. Tested strategies from contractors who went from invisible to booked solid.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Why Local SEO Is Different for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard local SEO advice often fails contractors.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">You're a service area business, not a storefront.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most local SEO guides assume customers will visit your location. For contractors, the opposite is true—you go to them. This changes how Google treats your business and how you should optimize.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google Business Profile gives you two options: show your address or hide it. If customers don't visit your location, hide it. Showing your garage or home address looks unprofessional and can create security issues. More importantly, it confuses Google about your actual service area.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Trust is the product.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Someone hiring a restaurant is risking $50 on a bad meal. Someone hiring a contractor is risking $15,000 and their home's integrity. The trust bar is higher.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your local SEO strategy needs to account for this. Reviews matter more. Photos matter more. Everything that signals legitimacy and professionalism matters more.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Competition is hyperlocal.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You're not competing with every contractor in the country. You're competing with 10-20 other businesses serving your specific area. Understanding exactly who shows up in the map pack for your target searches—and why—is essential.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Google Business Profile Optimization for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is probably worth more than your website for local leads. When someone searches "roofer near me," the map pack shows up first. Your website might not even appear above the fold.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most contractors set up their profile once and forget it. That's leaving money on the table.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Primary Category Selection</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is the single most important field in your profile. Google uses your primary category to determine which searches you're relevant for.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Be specific. "Roofing Contractor" beats "Contractor." "HVAC Contractor" beats "Home Improvement." If Google offers a category that exactly matches your primary service, use it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here's what contractors often get wrong: they pick a broad category hoping to rank for more searches. The opposite happens. Google shows more specific businesses first.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Secondary Categories</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Add every relevant secondary category. A roofing contractor might add: Gutter Cleaning Service, Siding Contractor, Roof Inspection Service. These won't hurt your primary rankings and can help you show up for related searches.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Service Area Configuration</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For service area businesses, your service area radius directly affects where you rank. Google won't show you in searches from areas you don't serve.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Be honest but strategic. If you'll drive an hour for a good job, include that radius. But if you've defined your service area as the entire state, Google gets confused about where to prioritize showing you.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">We typically recommend 20-30 miles for most contractors, adjustable based on your actual willingness to travel. You can list specific cities instead of a radius if that's more accurate.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Photos That Move the Needle</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Stock photos do nothing. Google knows the difference. Customers know the difference.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">What works:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Job site photos showing work in progress. Before and afters. These demonstrate you actually do the work you claim.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Team photos. Real humans in company shirts. Names are optional but helpful. This humanizes your business.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Equipment and trucks. Shows you're legitimate and equipped for the job.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Finished projects that look professional. High quality, well-lit, showcasing your best work.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Upload at least 10 photos to start. Add 2-3 new photos monthly. Google rewards fresh content, and newer photos often display first.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Posts: The Signal That Matters</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">GBP posts rarely generate direct traffic. Almost nobody reads them. So why bother?</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Because posting signals to Google that your business is active. We've tested this extensively across dozens of contractor profiles. Regular posting correlates with better map pack rankings.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Post weekly. Content doesn't need to be revolutionary. A completed project, a seasonal tip, a service highlight. Keep it under 300 words with an image.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Q&A: Free Keyword Optimization</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here's something most agencies don't tell you: you can ask and answer your own questions on your GBP.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Add questions your customers actually ask, then answer them thoroughly:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Q: "Do you offer emergency roof repair services?"
A: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout [City] and surrounding areas. Call us any time for storm damage, major leaks, or other roofing emergencies."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This puts keywords in your profile that help you rank for those specific searches. Add 5-10 Q&As covering your main services and common customer concerns.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Review Strategy for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Reviews are the most visible trust signal in local search. More reviews and higher ratings correlate strongly with map pack rankings and conversion rates.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">But the "how" matters as much as the "how many."</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">When to Ask</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Timing is everything. Ask immediately after job completion while the customer is still feeling good about the work. Not next week. Not in a follow-up email they'll ignore.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The moment you complete the walkthrough and they express satisfaction, that's the ask. Or within 30 minutes via text.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">How to Ask Without Being Sleazy</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, and it undermines the trust reviews are supposed to build.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The script that works:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Thanks for choosing us for this project. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review really helps other homeowners find us. I can text you the link right now."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Then text the direct review link. Not your website. Not "find us on Google." The actual link that opens the review form.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">To get your direct review link, search your business on Google, click your profile, click "Reviews," then click "Write a Review." Copy that URL. Or use a shortlink service to make it cleaner.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Review Velocity Matters</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Google pays attention to how consistently you generate reviews, not just your total count. A business with 50 reviews that got them all two years ago looks less relevant than a business with 30 reviews that got 3 in the last month.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Build review requests into your post-job process. Every job should include a review ask. Aim for 2-5 new reviews monthly minimum.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Responding to Negative Reviews</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You'll get negative reviews. Some deserved, some not. Your response matters more than the review itself.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Future customers read your responses carefully. They're looking to see: Are you defensive? Do you blame the customer? Or do you handle criticism professionally?</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Response framework:</p><ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Thank them for the feedback (even if it stings)</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Acknowledge the issue without admitting fault inappropriately</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Take the conversation offline: "Please contact us at [phone] so we can make this right."</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Keep it short and professional</li></ol><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Never argue. Never get defensive. Never reveal private details about the job. The response is for the audience watching, not the angry reviewer.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Citations That Actually Move the Needle</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Citation building" used to mean getting listed on 500 random directories. That stopped working years ago.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Today, citations matter for two reasons: sending referral traffic and validating your business information to Google. Quality beats quantity.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">The Core 20 That Matter</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Start with these and don't waste time beyond them until they're perfect:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Aggregators and Data Providers:*
Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook Business</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*General Directories:*
Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB (if member), Manta, Foursquare</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Industry-Specific:*
Angi (formerly Angie's List), HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Houzz, Porch, BuildZoom</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Trade-Specific* (varies by industry):
For roofers: RoofingContractor.com, GAF contractor finder
For HVAC: HVAC.com, carrier/brand directories
For plumbers: Plumber.com, trade associations</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Local:*
Chamber of Commerce, local business associations, city directories</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">NAP Consistency Is Non-Negotiable</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number. These must be identical everywhere. Not similar. Identical.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"123 Main Street Suite 100" and "123 Main St. Ste. 100" are different to Google. Pick one format and use it everywhere.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Audit your existing citations before building new ones. Tools like BrightLocal or Whitespark can help identify inconsistencies. Or do it manually—search your business name and check each listing.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Common mistakes: old addresses that were never updated, multiple phone numbers from call tracking gone wrong, business names that include unnecessary keywords ("Bob's Roofing - #1 Austin Roof Repair").</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">On-Page Local SEO</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your website supports your Google Business Profile, not the other way around. But it still needs proper optimization to rank in organic results and convert the traffic GBP sends you.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Location Page Structure</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you serve multiple cities, each one gets its own page. "Roofing in Austin" is different from "Roofing in Round Rock." Google treats them as separate search intents.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Structure for location pages:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">URL: /roofing/austin or /service-areas/austin</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">H1: Roofing Contractor in Austin, TX (or similar)</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Content: Unique content about serving that specific area. Mention neighborhoods, landmarks, local context. This isn't duplicate content with city names swapped—it's genuinely different pages.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Include: Service list, contact information, reviews from customers in that area if possible, photos from jobs in that area.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The minimum viable location page is about 500 words. Better ones run 800-1,200 with genuine local value.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Service + Location Combinations</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For larger service areas, create pages for service + location combinations:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">/roof-replacement/austin
/roof-repair/round-rock
/emergency-roofing/cedar-park</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This captures long-tail searches and gives you more ranking opportunities. A search for "roof repair round rock" will favor a page specifically about roof repair in Round Rock over a generic roof repair page.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Priority: create these for your highest-value services first, then expand based on search volume and competition.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Schema Markup for Local Business</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Schema is structured data that helps Google understand your business. It's invisible to visitors but important for search.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">At minimum, implement LocalBusiness schema on your homepage and location pages. This should include:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Business name</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Address (or service area)</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Phone number</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Hours</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Service type</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Geographic area served</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">Aggregate rating (if you have reviews on your site)</li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Here's what the JSON-LD should look like:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">```json

Check schema.org for the full list.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Test your schema with Google's Rich Results Test. Fix any errors. Invalid schema can hurt more than help.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For more help with technical implementation, <a href="/services/seo" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">our SEO services</a> include full schema setup and validation.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Link Building for Contractors</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Links remain one of the strongest ranking factors, but building them for local service businesses works differently than for tech companies or publishers.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Local Opportunities</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your existing business relationships are link opportunities:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Suppliers and distributors:* Many have "find a contractor" or dealer locator pages. If you buy from them, ask about getting listed.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Manufacturer programs:* GAF, Owens Corning, Carrier, Trane—major manufacturers have contractor networks with website listings.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Local business associations:* Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, industry-specific groups. Membership often includes a directory listing.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">*Partners:* Do you refer work to or receive work from other contractors? Link exchanges between complementary businesses (roofer and gutter installer, HVAC and electrician) are natural and valuable.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Sponsorships That Pass Value</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Sponsoring little league teams is great for community relations. But does it help SEO?</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Only if you get a link from a website with real authority. The $500 banner at the baseball field does nothing for Google. The $500 sponsorship that gets you a do-follow link from the school district's website? That moves the needle.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Look for sponsorship opportunities that include website mentions: local events, charity runs, school programs, community organizations. Ask specifically about website recognition, not just logo placement on physical materials.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Content That Earns Links Naturally</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Contractors rarely do content marketing well, which means opportunity for those who do.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Create local resources people actually want to link to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1"><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"How to Prepare Your [City] Home for Hurricane Season"</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"Average Cost of [Service] in [City]: 2026 Data"</li><li class="mb-3 text-[#86868B]">"Complete Guide to [City] Building Permits for [Project Type]"</li></ul><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Local journalists and bloggers link to useful local resources. Generic "5 Tips for Hiring a Roofer" content gets ignored.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">For a deeper dive into content strategy for contractors, our <a href="/blog/home-services-marketing-guide" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">home services marketing guide</a> covers this extensively.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Tracking Local SEO Success</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You can't improve what you can't measure. Most contractors have no idea if their SEO is working.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Google Business Profile Insights</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your GBP dashboard shows: search queries that triggered your listing, views, direction requests, phone calls, website clicks.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This data is directional, not perfect. Google aggregates and sometimes delays it. But month-over-month trends tell you if you're moving up or down.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Key metrics to track monthly:
- Total searches your profile appeared in
- Direct searches (people searching your business name)
- Discovery searches (people searching for what you offer)
- Phone calls from profile
- Website visits from profile
- Direction requests</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Rank Tracking by Location</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Where you rank depends on where the searcher is located. Someone in downtown Austin sees different results than someone in Round Rock, even for the same search.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Use a rank tracking tool that checks from multiple locations in your service area. BrightLocal, LocalFalcon, and GeoRanker all do this. They'll show you a grid of your rankings across different points in your territory.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Track your main keywords weekly. Look for patterns: strong in some areas, weak in others. This tells you where to focus optimization.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Call Tracking Attribution</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you're not tracking which marketing generates which phone calls, you're guessing.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Use a call tracking service (CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, WhatConverts) to assign unique phone numbers to different channels. Your GBP listing gets one number. Your website organic traffic gets another (via dynamic insertion). Your paid ads get another.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Now you know: "Last month, 47 calls from GBP, 23 from organic search, 12 from Google Ads."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">One caution: too many tracking numbers can create NAP inconsistency issues. Use dynamic number insertion on your website rather than hard-coding multiple numbers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">After working with dozens of contractors on local SEO, the same mistakes show up repeatedly.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Hiding the address when customers can visit.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you have a showroom or office customers can come to, show your address. Hiding it makes you look illegitimate and limits your ranking potential.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Service area too broad or too narrow.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Too broad (entire state) and Google doesn't know where to show you. Too narrow (one zip code) and you miss opportunities. Match it to your actual service willingness.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Keyword stuffing the business name.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Bob's Roofing | Best Austin Roofing Company | Emergency Roof Repair" isn't your business name. Google knows it, and this can get your listing suspended. Use your actual business name only.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Ignoring profile completeness.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Every empty field is a missed opportunity. Fill out services, attributes, hours, Q&A, photos—all of it.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">One-and-done mindset.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">GBP isn't "set it and forget it." Regular updates, fresh photos, new reviews, and weekly posts signal an active business.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Next Steps</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Local SEO for contractors comes down to a few fundamentals: a fully optimized Google Business Profile, consistent NAP across quality citations, a review generation system, and a website that supports it all.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The contractors who dominate the map pack in their area do these basics consistently. They don't chase shortcuts. They build the machine and keep it running.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you want help implementing this—building the technical foundation, setting up tracking, or developing a local content strategy—<a href="/contact" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">reach out to talk</a>.

For contractors, the opposite is true—you go to them. This changes how Google treats your business and how you should optimize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed\"\u003eGoogle Business Profile gives you two options: show your address or hide it. If customers don't visit your location, hide it. Showing your garage or home address looks unprofessional and can create security issues. More importantly, it confuses Google about your actual service area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4\"\u003eTrust is the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed\"\u003eSomeone hiring a restaurant is risking $50 on a bad meal. Someone hiring a contractor is risking $15,000 and their home's integrity. The trust bar is higher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed\"\u003eYour local SEO strategy needs to account for this. Reviews matter more. Photos matter more. Everything that signals legitimacy and professionalism matters more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4\"\u003eCompetition is hyperlocal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed\"\u003eYou're not competing with every contractor in the country. You're competing with 10-20 other businesses serving your specific area.

Your website might not even appear above the fold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed\"\u003eMost contractors set up their profile once and forget it.

If you'll drive an hour for a good job, include that radius.
