I've worked with HVAC contractors who turned away jobs in peak season because they couldn't handle the volume, then laid off technicians three months later.<blockquote class="my-8 pl-6 border-l-4 border-[#00D4FF] italic">

Here's how to actually do it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">The HVAC Marketing Challenge</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">HVAC has three characteristics that break normal marketing rules.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Extreme seasonality.</strong> Your phone rings off the hook when the first heat wave hits or the first freeze arrives. The rest of the year, you're fighting for scraps. Google Trends data shows "AC repair" searches spike 400% between May and August compared to winter months. That's not a gentle curve. That's a cliff.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Emergency vs. planned work.</strong> When someone's AC dies at 2pm on a 98-degree Saturday, they're calling whoever answers first. That's a completely different sale than someone researching new HVAC systems for a home they're building. Different intent, different timeline, different marketing approach.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">

A $150 tune-up and a $12,000 system replacement require completely different marketing approaches. Treating them the same means overpaying for one or underinvesting in the other.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Understanding these dynamics shapes everything that follows.

You have time to schedule, upsell, and deliver quality service without emergency pressure.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">What to push:</strong> AC tune-ups, maintenance plan signups, system inspections, indoor air quality services.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">The angle:</strong> "Get ahead of summer. Schedule your AC tune-up before the rush." Fear of being stuck without AC when temperatures hit triple digits is real. Use it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Ad messaging that works:</strong> "AC tune-ups fill up fast in May.

          <p class="text-[#1D1D1F] m-0">When it's 102 degrees and the AC just died, nobody's waiting for your slow site. If your website takes more than 2 seconds to load on mobile, you're losing emergency calls to competitors.<p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Implement call tracking with whisper messages so your team knows immediately: "This call is from Google Ads - emergency AC repair." That context helps them answer appropriately.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Ad strategy shifts:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Increase your LSA budget to maximum. Local Service Ads dominate emergency searches. When someone searches "AC repair near me," LSAs appear above everything else. You want that top spot.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Add "emergency" and "same-day" modifiers to your Google Search campaigns. "Emergency AC repair" has 3x the conversion rate of generic "AC repair" searches, even though it costs more per click.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Enable ad scheduling to increase bids during extreme weather days.

"Make sure your furnace is safe before you turn it on" resonates more than "stay warm this winter."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Timing nuances:</strong> Start heating campaigns right after Labor Day in northern states, late October in southern states. Match your market's weather patterns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is also prime time for system replacement sales. Homeowners who struggled through summer with an aging AC are thinking about replacement before winter hits.

Link to it from every service page.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Point-of-service promotion:</strong> After every repair call, your technicians should mention the maintenance plan. "This repair was $350. If you'd had our maintenance plan, you'd have gotten 15% off, and we probably would have caught this during your tune-up."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Seasonal campaigns:</strong> Run maintenance plan promotions in shoulder seasons when you have capacity. "Sign up in March, get your first tune-up free" moves the needle.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Email Marketing to Existing Customers</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your customer list is gold. Most contractors ignore it.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Quarterly seasonal emails:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">March: "Summer's coming. Schedule your AC tune-up."
June: "Beat the heat. Our emergency line is available 24/7."
September: "Don't get caught in the cold. Book your furnace inspection."
December: "Thank you for a great year. Here's a special offer for loyal customers."</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Maintenance reminder automation:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">When a customer gets a tune-up, mark the date. 10 months later, send an automated email: "It's almost time for your annual AC tune-up. Click here to schedule."</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is basic email automation. Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or your CRM can handle it. Setup takes an afternoon.

List specific cities.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Create a service area page with every city and neighborhood you cover. This helps SEO and helps users immediately know if you can help them.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Include a map if possible. Visual confirmation matters.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Tracking and Attribution</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Without proper tracking, you're guessing.

One tracking number for Google Business Profile.
One tracking number for organic website visitors.
One tracking number for Facebook.
Dynamic number insertion on your website that swaps numbers based on traffic source.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Call categorization:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Tag calls as emergency vs. scheduled during or after the call. Your phone tracking software (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics) can add tags.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Over time, you'll see patterns. Maybe Google Ads generates 80% emergency calls. Maybe organic traffic generates more scheduled maintenance requests. That data shapes where you spend.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Lead Source by Season</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Build a simple dashboard that shows lead sources by month.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You'll likely discover that certain channels dominate certain seasons. LSAs might generate 60% of your summer leads but only 30% in spring. Organic might provide consistent year-round traffic while paid varies dramatically.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This informs budget allocation. If organic provides your shoulder-season floor, protect your <a href="/services/seo" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">SEO investment</a>. If LSAs dominate peaks, make sure your profile is optimized before each peak season starts.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Attribution to closed jobs:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The real insight comes from tracking which leads become customers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Integrate your call tracking with your CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber). When a job closes, you should be able to trace it back to the original marketing source.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A $12,000 system replacement that came from organic search has a different value than a $150 tune-up from a Facebook ad. Your marketing decisions should reflect that difference.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Making This Work</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">HVAC marketing isn't set-it-and-forget-it. The companies that dominate their markets adjust constantly.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-[#1D1D1F]">Weekly tasks:</strong>

They still have busy seasons and slow seasons. But the extremes flatten out.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">What Comes Next</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is a lot to implement. Most contractors won't do it all. That's fine. Start with what matters most for your situation.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If your phone doesn't ring in spring: Focus on maintenance plan promotion and seasonal email campaigns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you're losing emergency calls to competitors: Fix your website speed, LSA optimization, and call response time.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you don't know what's working: Set up proper tracking first. Every other decision depends on it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you want help building this system instead of figuring it out yourself, that's what we do.
