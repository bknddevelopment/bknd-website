Most homeowners can't write that check casually.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">What to include:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Dedicated financing page explaining your options (Wells Fargo, GreenSky, Synchrony, whatever you use).</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Monthly payment estimates on system replacement pages. "$12,000 system or $189/month for 72 months" is easier to process than a raw price.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"Financing available" messaging on service pages. Even if they're looking at repairs now, knowing financing exists plants a seed for future replacement conversations.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Service Area Clarity</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">"We serve the greater metro area" is useless. List specific cities.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Create a service area page with every city and neighborhood you cover. This helps SEO and helps users immediately know if you can help them.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Include a map if possible. Visual confirmation matters.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Tracking and Attribution</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Without proper tracking, you're guessing. And your guesses are probably wrong.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Call Tracking for Emergency vs. Planned</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Different call sources require different handling.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Setup structure:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">One tracking number for your Google Ads campaigns.
One tracking number for Google Business Profile.
One tracking number for organic website visitors.
One tracking number for Facebook.
Dynamic number insertion on your website that swaps numbers based on traffic source.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Call categorization:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Tag calls as emergency vs. scheduled during or after the call. Your phone tracking software (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics) can add tags.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Over time, you'll see patterns. Maybe Google Ads generates 80% emergency calls. Maybe organic traffic generates more scheduled maintenance requests. That data shapes where you spend.</p><h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-10 mb-4">Lead Source by Season</h3><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Build a simple dashboard that shows lead sources by month.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">You'll likely discover that certain channels dominate certain seasons. LSAs might generate 60% of your summer leads but only 30% in spring. Organic might provide consistent year-round traffic while paid varies dramatically.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This informs budget allocation. If organic provides your shoulder-season floor, protect your <a href="/services/seo" class="text-[#00D4FF] hover:underline">SEO investment</a>. If LSAs dominate peaks, make sure your profile is optimized before each peak season starts.</p><p class="text-[#1D1D1F] font-semibold mb-4">Attribution to closed jobs:</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">The real insight comes from tracking which leads become customers.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">Integrate your call tracking with your CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber). When a job closes, you should be able to trace it back to the original marketing source.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">A $12,000 system replacement that came from organic search has a different value than a $150 tune-up from a Facebook ad. Your marketing decisions should reflect that difference.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">Making This Work</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">HVAC marketing isn't set-it-and-forget-it.

They still have busy seasons and slow seasons. But the extremes flatten out.</p><h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#1D1D1F] mt-12 mb-6">What Comes Next</h2><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is a lot to implement. Most contractors won't do it all. That's fine. Start with what matters most for your situation.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If your phone doesn't ring in spring: Focus on maintenance plan promotion and seasonal email campaigns.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you're losing emergency calls to competitors: Fix your website speed, LSA optimization, and call response time.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you don't know what's working: Set up proper tracking first. Every other decision depends on it.</p><p class="text-[#86868B] mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you want help building this system instead of figuring it out yourself, that's what we do.
