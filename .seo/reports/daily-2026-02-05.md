# SEO Daily Report -- BKND Development

## February 5, 2026 (First Baseline Report)

---

### Executive Summary

- **Your site is live, healthy, and Google knows about it.** SSL is valid, sitemap is in place, Google Analytics and Search Console are both connected. The foundation is solid.
- **You are currently ranking for 32 keywords, but none are on page 1 of Google.** Your best position is #23 for "developer mode squarespace." You have zero rankings for your actual target keywords like "AI marketing agency" or "GEO optimization."
- **There is a massive, time-sensitive opportunity in GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).** This keyword cluster is exploding -- up 1,660% year over year -- and some of the keywords have literally ZERO competition. You already have a GEO service page. This is your biggest first-mover advantage.
- **A critical technical issue was found: duplicate content.** Every blog post on your site is accessible at two different URLs (for example, both `/blog/article-name` and `/ai/article-name`). Google sees these as separate pages with the same content, which dilutes your ranking power. This needs to be fixed before anything else.
- **Several service pages still reference your old GitHub Pages domain** in their behind-the-scenes code (schema markup), which sends confusing signals to Google. Quick fix, high impact.

### Current Rankings Baseline

Your site currently ranks for **32 keywords** in Google. Here is where things stand:

| Position Range   | # of Keywords | What This Means                        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Page 1 (1-10)    | 0             | Nobody finds you on page 1 yet         |
| Page 2 (11-20)   | 0             | Not visible on page 2 either           |
| Page 3 (21-30)   | 4             | Barely visible -- users rarely go here |
| Page 4 (31-40)   | 5             | Very low visibility                    |
| Page 5+ (41-100) | 23            | Essentially invisible                  |

**Your top 10 ranking keywords today:**

| Keyword                       | Position | Monthly Searches | Page Ranking                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| developer mode squarespace    | #23      | 110              | /resources/squarespace-developer-limitations |
| squarespace developer mode    | #23      | 110              | /resources/squarespace-developer-limitations |
| cranford businesses           | #30      | 40               | /locations/cranford/                         |
| cranford chamber of commerce  | #30      | 50               | /locations/cranford/                         |
| businesses in cranford nj     | #31      | 40               | /locations/cranford/                         |
| elizabeth development company | #34      | 170              | /locations/elizabeth-nj/                     |
| cranford nj businesses        | #35      | 40               | /locations/cranford/                         |
| business in elizabeth nj      | #37      | 30               | /locations/elizabeth-nj/                     |
| edc elizabeth nj              | #38      | 30               | /locations/elizabeth-nj/                     |
| shopify calculator            | #47      | 140              | /resources/shopify-true-cost-calculator/     |

**The honest assessment:** Most of your current rankings are for NJ location-based queries (Cranford, Elizabeth, Westfield, Summit) and resource/tool pages (Squarespace, Shopify, Webflow). Only 5 out of 32 keywords relate to your actual marketing services, and they are all ranking #55 or worse. You have **zero rankings** for your primary target keywords (AI marketing agency, GEO optimization, etc.).

This is completely normal for a newer domain. Google is in the "discovery phase" -- it sees your site and is starting to catalog it, but trust and authority still need to be built. The good news: 28 of your 32 keywords are brand new appearances, meaning Google is actively discovering your content right now.

### Keyword Opportunities

#### Priority 1: GEO / Generative Engine Optimization (THE BIG ONE)

This is your single biggest opportunity. Here is why:

- **"GEO optimization"** gets 720 searches/month and grew **1,660% in the past year**
- **"generative engine optimization geo"** gets 720 searches/month, grew **4,233% year over year**
- Several keywords in this cluster have a **keyword difficulty of literally 0** -- meaning nobody has properly optimized for them yet
- You already have a dedicated GEO service page at `/services/ai/geo/`
- This market is brand new and exploding. Getting in early means establishing authority before the competition catches up.

**Quick wins in the GEO cluster:**

| Keyword                                     | Monthly Searches | Difficulty | Why It's a Quick Win                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| generative engine optimization geo services | 110              | 0 (!)      | Brand new keyword, no competition at all. Your GEO page should target this. |
| generative engine optimization geo tools    | 70               | 0 (!)      | Another zero-competition keyword. A tools/resources page could rank fast.   |
| geo ai optimization                         | 40               | 25 (low)   | Directly aligned with your AI + GEO positioning.                            |
| what is geo optimization                    | 70               | 30 (low)   | Perfect topic for a definitive blog post or FAQ.                            |
| geo engine optimization                     | 50               | 34 (low)   | Exact match for your GEO service page.                                      |

#### Priority 2: AI Marketing Agency

- **"ai marketing agency"** gets 1,600 searches/month with difficulty of 28 (achievable)
- **"ai powered marketing agency"** grew 1,600% year over year
- **"what is an ai marketing agency"** has a difficulty of only 3 -- a blog post could rank easily

| Keyword                        | Monthly Searches | Difficulty | Opportunity                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ai marketing agency            | 1,600            | 28         | Your primary brand keyword. Needs strong homepage optimization + backlinks. |
| ai digital marketing agency    | 320              | 44         | Secondary target for service pages.                                         |
| ai driven marketing agency     | 50               | 22         | Low difficulty, target on homepage.                                         |
| what is an ai marketing agency | 40               | 3          | Write a definitive blog post -- should rank easily.                         |
| ai for marketing agency        | 40               | 25         | Growing 400% year over year. Commercial intent.                             |

#### Priority 3: Local NJ Marketing

You already rank (weakly) for some NJ location terms. Pushing these into the top 20 is achievable:

| Keyword                   | Current Position | Monthly Searches |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| nj internet marketing     | #88              | 590              |
| email marketing agency nj | #94              | 90               |
| seo google local business | #55              | 110              |

### Technical Issues Found

#### CRITICAL: Duplicate Content Problem

**What is happening:** Every blog post on your site can be reached at TWO different web addresses. For example, an article about AI marketing can be found at both:

- `bknddevelopment.com/blog/ai-article-name`
- `bknddevelopment.com/ai/ai-article-name`

Both URLs show the exact same article content.

**Why this matters:** Google treats these as two separate pages competing against each other. Instead of one strong page, you have two weak ones splitting your ranking power in half. Your sitemap (which tells Google what to crawl) explicitly lists BOTH versions for all ~35 articles, creating roughly 70 article pages where there should be 35. This is actively hurting your ability to rank.

**What needs to happen:** We need to pick ONE URL pattern as the "official" version and tell Google to ignore the other. The recommended fix is to make the hub URLs (`/ai/`, `/marketing/`, etc.) the official versions because they already have better structured data.

#### HIGH: Wrong Domain in Service Page Code

**What is happening:** Eight of your service pages (SEO, Analytics, Creative, CRO, AI Custom, AI Automation, AI GEO, and AI Methodology) still have your old GitHub Pages domain (`charwinvanryckdegroot.github.io/bknd-website`) embedded in their behind-the-scenes code (schema markup and social sharing tags). Your homepage correctly uses `bknddevelopment.com`, but these pages do not match.

**Why this matters:** Google sees conflicting information -- your homepage says "I'm bknddevelopment.com" but your service pages say "I'm charwinvanryckdegroot.github.io." This creates trust issues with structured data and makes social sharing links point to the wrong place.

**What needs to happen:** A straightforward find-and-replace across 8 files. Quick fix.

#### HIGH: Missing Canonical Tags

**What is happening:** None of your blog posts, content hub pages, or content hub article pages have "canonical tags." A canonical tag is a small piece of code that tells Google, "This is the official version of this page."

**Why this matters:** Without these tags, Google has to guess which version of your content is the "real" one. Combined with the duplicate content issue above, this creates maximum confusion for Google's indexing.

#### HIGH: AI Services Page Missing Metadata

**What is happening:** Your AI Services page (`/services/ai/`) -- arguably your most important service page -- has no page-specific title, description, or structured data. It is the only major service page without this. In Google search results, it would show up with your generic homepage title instead of something like "AI Marketing Services | BKND Development."

#### MEDIUM: Other Issues

- **Empty "Industries" dropdown in navigation** -- the menu item exists but goes nowhere, which looks unprofessional and wastes a prime navigation spot
- **"Services" and "Work With Us" links in the header only work on the homepage** -- on any other page, clicking them does nothing useful
- **Content hub pages not linked in the footer** -- missing internal links that help Google discover your content hubs
- **Organization schema missing social profiles** -- your LinkedIn URL should be connected to your company identity in Google's eyes
- **Fake search function in schema** -- your site tells Google it has a search bar, but it does not (it is a static site). This could trigger a warning from Google.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Fix duplicate content: Add canonical tags to all article pages**              | Every blog post is being split across 2 URLs. This is your #1 technical problem.            | HIGH -- stops ranking dilution across all 35+ articles   |
| 2   | **Clean up sitemap: Remove duplicate URLs**                                     | The sitemap currently tells Google to index both versions of every article.                 | HIGH -- cuts wasted crawl budget in half                 |
| 3   | **Replace old GitHub domain in service page schemas**                           | 8 service pages reference the wrong domain in their structured data.                        | HIGH -- fixes trust signals on your most important pages |
| 4   | **Optimize GEO service page for "generative engine optimization geo services"** | This keyword has zero competition and is exploding in search volume. First-mover advantage. | HIGH -- potential page 1 ranking on an emerging keyword  |
| 5   | **Add metadata/schema to AI Services page**                                     | Your most important service page is invisible to Google's rich results.                     | MEDIUM -- unlocks rich snippets for AI services          |
| 6   | **Add self-referencing canonical tags to all hub landing pages**                | Content hub pages (/ai, /marketing, etc.) need to declare themselves as official.           | MEDIUM -- prevents future indexing confusion             |
| 7   | **Fix header navigation links**                                                 | "Services" and "Work With Us" links break on non-homepage pages.                            | MEDIUM -- improves user experience and internal linking  |
| 8   | **Add content hub links to footer**                                             | More internal links to hub pages helps Google discover and rank them.                       | LOW-MEDIUM -- improves crawl coverage                    |

### Blockers / Needs Your Input

#### Decision Needed: Canonical URL Strategy

We need to pick which URL pattern is the "official" one for your blog articles:

- **Option A (Recommended):** Hub URLs are official (`/ai/article-name`, `/marketing/article-name`, etc.)
  - Pros: These already have richer structured data, and the URL itself tells Google what topic the article covers
  - Cons: The `/blog/` page would link to hub URLs instead of `/blog/` URLs

- **Option B:** Blog URLs are official (`/blog/article-name`)
  - Pros: Simpler, all articles under one path
  - Cons: Loses the topical URL structure and would need schema added to blog pages

**My recommendation:** Option A. The hub structure is better for SEO long-term because it builds topical authority (all AI articles under `/ai/`, all marketing articles under `/marketing/`, etc.).

#### Information Needed: Google Search Console Verification

Your site appears to have GSC verified, and a verification tag was added in recent commits. However, we should confirm: **How was Google Search Console originally verified?** (Was it through a meta tag, DNS record, or Google Analytics?) This matters because if the verification method changes or lapses, we lose access to search performance data.

#### Data Gap: Backlink Profile

We could not pull backlink data because the DataForSEO Backlinks API subscription is not active. Backlinks are one of the top 3 ranking factors. To understand your full picture, we either need:

- DataForSEO Backlinks API activated, OR
- A free alternative like Ahrefs Webmaster Tools or Moz Link Explorer
