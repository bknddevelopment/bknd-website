## Priority Content (Based on 2026-02-05 Keyword Research)

### Tier 1: Immediate (KD 0 -- First-Mover Advantage)

These keywords have ZERO competition and are exploding in search volume. Act NOW.

| Priority | Target Keyword                              | Volume | KD  | Content Type              | Target URL                              | Status                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | --- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| P1-A     | generative engine optimization geo services | 110    | 0   | Service page optimization | /services/ai/geo/                       | Page exists -- needs keyword optimization |
