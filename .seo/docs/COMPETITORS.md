# Competitor Analysis - BKND Development

## Competitor Landscape Overview (2026-02-05)

DataForSEO found 1,354 domains with overlapping keyword rankings. However, the vast majority are generic large domains (YouTube, Yelp, Facebook, Reddit) because BKND's current rankings are primarily for local NJ queries and resource pages, NOT marketing service keywords.

**Key insight:** True marketing agency competitors (e.g., SingleGrain, Neil Patel, HubSpot) do NOT appear in the overlap analysis because BKND doesn't yet rank for the same marketing service keywords they do. As BKND begins ranking for AI marketing and GEO keywords, the competitor landscape will shift dramatically.

## Notes

- The competitor landscape is skewed by BKND's current ranking profile (mostly NJ location queries)
- Once BKND starts ranking for AI marketing and GEO keywords, real competitors like SingleGrain, Directive, WebFX, and other marketing agencies will appear
- Need to run dedicated competitor analysis on "ai marketing agency" and "geo optimization" SERPs to identify the actual competitors for those terms
- dubsbusinessadvisor.com warrants deeper investigation -- pull their full keyword profile on next analysis
