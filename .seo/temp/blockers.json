One new medium-severity blocker identified: no google-site-verification meta tag found in the codebase -- GSC verification method should be confirmed to ensure ongoing access. No pending approvals. Phase 1 cannot progress to baseline metrics, technical audit, or quick wins until data sources are connected and first pulls are completed."
