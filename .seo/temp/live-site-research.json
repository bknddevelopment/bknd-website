  "summary": "The BKND Development live site has several critical SEO issues that are likely suppressing search visibility. The most damaging problem is that canonical tags on the majority of pages (blog posts, hub pages, some service pages, about page) all point to the homepage, which tells Google every page is a duplicate of the homepage. Combined with 44 duplicate blog/hub article pairs in the sitemap (each article exists at both /blog/slug and /hub/slug with identical content and no canonical differentiation), this creates massive duplicate content signals. Additionally, 5+ service pages still reference the old GitHub Pages domain (charwinvanryckdegroot.github.io/bknd-website) in their JSON-LD schemas and OG tags, which confuses search engines about site identity. The /services/ai/ page has zero unique metadata and is essentially invisible as a distinct page to Google. Navigation anchor links (#services, #resources, etc.) are broken on all non-homepage pages. The Organization schema has an empty sameAs array (no social profiles) and a non-functional SearchAction pointing to a search endpoint that does not exist on this static site. Content hubs are not linked from the footer, missing a key internal linking opportunity."
