Three commits landed: (1) 20 new professional blog posts with a category system across 4 content hubs (AI, Marketing, SEO Insights, Industry News), (2) code reformatting across all files, and (3) sitemap update. New pages include 4 content hub landing pages with dynamic article routes, 2 new AI service pages (GEO, Automation), and an AI methodology page. The sitemap expanded from ~20 to ~97 URLs. Key SEO concern: blog posts are duplicated across /blog/[slug] and /[hub]/[slug] paths in the sitemap without apparent canonical resolution, which could cause duplicate content indexing issues. Google Search Console verification was added. robots.txt and favicon/OG image paths were corrected for the production domain."
