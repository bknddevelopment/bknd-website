    title: 'Roofing Company Marketing: 15 Strategies That Generate Leads',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most roofing marketing advice ignores seasonality, storm chasing, and the trust problem. Here are 15 strategies that actually fill your pipeline.',
    content: `
Roofing is one of the hardest businesses to market. Not because it's complicated, but because most marketing advice doesn't account for what makes roofing different.

You're selling something invisible until there's a problem. Your customers don't think about you until water is dripping through their ceiling or a hailstorm just passed through. And when they do need you, they're calling three other companies too.

This guide covers 15 strategies that actually work for roofing companies. No theory. Just what generates leads and closes jobs.

## Why Roofing Marketing Is Different

Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard marketing advice fails for roofers.

**Seasonality runs everything.** Spring storms create a surge. Winter kills lead flow in most markets. You can't just "run consistent campaigns" and expect consistent results. Your marketing has to flex with demand.

**Storm chasing changed the game.** After major storms, out-of-town crews flood your market. They're knocking doors, running aggressive ads, and competing for the same insurance jobs. You need a strategy that builds local trust faster than they can.

**High ticket means high skepticism.** A $12,000 roof replacement isn't an impulse buy. Homeowners research, compare, and worry about getting scammed. Your marketing needs to build trust before they'll even pick up the phone.

**Insurance work adds complexity.** Many roofing jobs involve insurance claims. Your marketing needs to speak to both direct-pay customers and storm damage victims navigating insurance processes. Different audiences, different messages.

Now for the strategies.

## 1. Google Business Profile Domination

Your Google Business Profile is the single most important marketing asset you own. When someone searches "roofer near me" or "roof repair [city]", the map pack results get more clicks than anything else.

Most roofers set up their profile and forget it. That's a mistake.

**Complete every field.** Services, service areas, hours, attributes. Google rewards completeness. Takes 30 minutes.

**Add photos weekly.** Before and after shots of actual jobs. Crew photos. Truck photos. Not stock images. Google's algorithm can identify generic stock photos, and so can customers.

**Post updates weekly.** Nobody reads them, but posting signals to Google that you're an active business. We've tested profiles with weekly posts against identical profiles without. The posting profiles rank higher.

**Optimize Q&A.** Add your own questions and answers. "Do you handle insurance claims?" "Yes, we work directly with all major insurance providers for storm damage claims." Free keyword optimization that competitors ignore.

**Categories matter.** "Roofing Contractor" as your primary category. Add "Roof Inspection Service" and "Gutter Installation Service" as secondary categories if you offer those services.

This alone can put you in the map pack for high-intent local searches. Free leads, recurring monthly.

## 2. Local SEO for "[City] Roofing Contractor"

Beyond your Google Business Profile, you need your website ranking for local searches. This means [building out location and service pages](/services/seo) that target specific keywords.

Every city you serve needs its own page. "Roofing Contractor Austin" is different from "Roofing Contractor Round Rock." These pages need:

**Unique content.** Not the same page with the city name swapped. Write about that specific area. Mention neighborhoods. Reference local landmarks. Google knows the difference between unique content and find-replace.

**Testimonials from that area.** If you have reviews from Round Rock customers, feature them on the Round Rock page.

**NAP consistency.** Your name, address, and phone number must match exactly across your website, Google Business Profile, and every directory you're listed on. "123 Main St" and "123 Main Street" are different to Google.

**Schema markup.** LocalBusiness structured data on every location page. This tells Google explicitly that you serve that area. Your developer can implement this in under an hour.

For a roofing company serving 8-10 cities, building out proper location pages can generate 50+ additional organic leads per month. It's tedious work, but the compound returns are significant.

## 3. Google Ads for Roofing

[Google Ads](/services/paid-advertising) for roofing is expensive. CPCs for "roof replacement" can hit $30-50 in competitive markets. But done right, it's also the highest-intent traffic you can buy.

**Start with exact match keywords.** Broad match for roofing is a budget incinerator. Google will happily spend your money on "roofing jobs" (employment seekers), "DIY roof repair" (not hiring anyone), and "roofing materials near me" (contractors, not customers).

**Build a negative keyword list immediately.** Add: jobs, employment, career, DIY, how to, supply, supplies, materials, wholesale, contractor license, training. Review your search terms report weekly and add more.

**Keyword structure that works:**

High intent (bid aggressively):
- roof replacement + [city]
- emergency roof repair
- storm damage roof repair
- roofing company near me

Medium intent (bid moderately):
- roof inspection + [city]
- roof leak repair
- new roof cost

Low intent (bid conservatively or skip):
- best roofing materials
- how long does a roof last
- signs you need a new roof

**Budget reality:** In most markets, you need $2,000-5,000/month to test Google Ads properly. Below that, you don't have enough data to optimize. If your budget is under $2,000, focus on Local Service Ads and SEO instead.

**Landing pages matter.** Don't send paid traffic to your homepage. Build dedicated landing pages for each service. Roof replacement ads go to a roof replacement page with specific pricing information, photos, and a single clear call-to-action.

## 4. Local Service Ads: The Roofing Advantage

Local Service Ads (LSAs) should be your first paid investment. Unlike standard Google Ads, you only pay when someone actually contacts you.

For roofing companies, LSAs have two major advantages.

**Trust signals are built in.** The Google Guaranteed badge means Google has verified your insurance, licensing, and background checks. This immediately differentiates you from storm chasers.

**Pay-per-lead, not pay-per-click.** You're not paying for tire-kickers who clicked an ad and bounced. You're paying for phone calls and messages from people who want to hire a roofer.

**Getting the most from LSAs:**

Response time affects your ranking. Answer calls immediately. Return messages within minutes. Google tracks this.

Reviews heavily influence LSA rankings. More Google reviews with higher ratings means more LSA visibility. This compounds with your organic GBP efforts.

Set your budget by leads, not dollars. Calculate what you can afford to pay per lead based on your close rate and average job value. A $50 lead that closes 20% of the time at $10,000 average job value is wildly profitable.

The limitation: LSA inventory is limited. You can't just spend more to get more leads like traditional ads. But max out LSAs before investing heavily in standard Google Ads.

## 5. Review Generation That Actually Works

Reviews are currency in roofing. They affect your Google rankings, your LSA positioning, and whether a prospect calls you or your competitor.

The mistake most roofers make: they ask for reviews months after the job, if at all.

**The right timing:** Request the review the same day the job completes, while the customer is still happy about their new roof. Not a week later when they've moved on mentally.

**The right method:** Text, not email. A text with a direct link to your Google review page gets 10x the response rate of email. Keep it short: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us for your roof. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"

**The right volume:** Aim for 5-10 new reviews per month. Consistent review velocity signals to Google that you're an active, legitimate business.

**Responding to reviews:** Every single one. Positive reviews get a quick thank you. Negative reviews get a professional response that acknowledges the issue and offers resolution. Future customers read your responses as carefully as the reviews themselves.

**Never offer incentives for reviews.** It's against Google's terms, it looks sketchy, and one customer calling you out for it destroys your credibility. The ask alone is enough if you've done good work.

## 6. A Website That Actually Converts

Your website's job is to convert visitors into phone calls. Everything else is secondary.

Most roofing websites fail at this. They're slow. They bury contact information. They look like every other roofing site with the same stock photos.

**What converts for roofing:**

Before and after galleries. Real photos of actual jobs you've completed. This is the single most persuasive element on a roofing website. Customers want to see your work, not stock photos of generic roofs.

Financing information upfront. A $12,000 roof is a lot of money. If you offer financing, say so prominently. "$89/month with approved credit" converts better than hiding financing options on a separate page.

Clear pricing guidance. You don't need exact quotes, but ranges help. "Typical roof replacement in [city]: $8,000-$15,000 depending on size and materials." This qualifies leads and builds trust through transparency.

Phone number visible everywhere. Sticky header with click-to-call on mobile. Phone number on every page. Make it impossible to miss.

Fast load times. Over 70% of searches happen on mobile. If your site takes 5 seconds to load on a phone, half your visitors are gone before they see anything.

Trust signals throughout. Licensing info, insurance badges, manufacturer certifications, years in business, BBB rating. These should be visible on every page, not buried on an about page.

A [properly optimized roofing website](/services/cro) can double your conversion rate from the same traffic. That's twice the leads for zero additional ad spend.

## 7. Storm Damage Content Strategy

Storm damage is where roofing marketing gets seasonal. After a major hail event or windstorm, search volume spikes dramatically. Homeowners need help fast.

**Create content before the storms hit:**

"What to do after a hailstorm damages your roof" - Step by step guide
"How to file a roof insurance claim in [state]" - Insurance process walkthrough
"Signs of storm damage on your roof" - Visual guide with photos
"Storm damage roof repair vs replacement" - Decision framework

This content ranks before the storm. When the storm hits, you're already on page one while competitors scramble.

**Storm-specific landing pages:**

After major events, create dedicated pages. "May 2026 Austin Hailstorm Roof Damage" with:
- Date and affected areas
- What homeowners should do
- Your inspection availability
- Insurance claim assistance info

These pages capture hyperlocal, time-sensitive search intent.

**Social proof from storm work:**

Document your storm response. How many roofs did you replace after the last major storm? Customer testimonials specifically about insurance claim assistance. This builds credibility for the next event.

## 8. Facebook and Instagram for Roofing

Social media for roofing isn't about virality. Nobody shares roofing content. It's about staying visible to people in your service area and retargeting website visitors.

**What works on Facebook:**

Before and after transformations. These perform well visually. Split image showing the destroyed roof next to the beautiful new installation.

Time-lapse project videos. Condense a 3-day job into a 30-second video. People find this surprisingly satisfying to watch.

Team content. Crew photos, company events, community involvement. This humanizes your business against faceless competitors.

Customer testimonial videos. A 30-second clip of a happy customer is more persuasive than any written testimonial.

**Facebook Ads strategy:**

Retargeting first. Someone visited your website but didn't call? Show them testimonial ads for the next 30 days. This is cheap and effective.

Lookalike audiences second. Upload your customer list and target people who match their demographics and behaviors.

Skip broad awareness campaigns. The ROI rarely works for local service businesses.

Budget: $500-1,500/month for retargeting and lookalikes is usually sufficient.

## 9. Nextdoor Marketing

Nextdoor is underutilized by most contractors. It's a hyperlocal platform where neighbors recommend service providers to each other.

**Claim your business page.** This is free. Complete your profile, add photos, respond to recommendations.

**Encourage customers to recommend you on Nextdoor specifically.** After a job, ask: "If you know anyone in the neighborhood who needs roofing work, we'd appreciate a mention on Nextdoor."

**Run local deals.** Nextdoor allows local businesses to promote offers to specific neighborhoods. A "Free roof inspection for [Neighborhood Name] residents" drives leads directly.

**Monitor neighborhood posts.** When someone asks "Can anyone recommend a roofer?", you want to be the one they're recommending. This requires having done good work in that neighborhood already.

## 10. Referral Programs That Work

Word of mouth is still the best marketing. The question is whether you're actively cultivating it or just hoping it happens.

**Structure that works for roofing:**

$200-500 referral bonus for customers who refer someone that closes. Cash or gift card, their choice. Make it meaningful enough to remember.

Inform customers during the job. Not after. "If you know anyone else who needs roofing work, we offer a $300 referral bonus." Plant the seed while you're top of mind.

Follow up specifically about referrals. Two weeks after job completion, send a text: "Enjoying your new roof? If any neighbors need work, here's our referral link: [tracking link]"

Track referrals rigorously. Know exactly which customers sent which referrals and pay promptly. A delayed bonus kills future referrals.

**Referral cards work too.** Leave physical cards with customers. "Give this to a friend" with a code that tracks back to them. Old school, but effective.

## 11. Door-to-Door Plus Digital Follow-Up

Door knocking isn't dead for roofing. It's especially effective after storms when homeowners are actively looking for help.

**Modern door-to-door:**

Leave behind more than a card. A one-page handout with: your company info, what to look for on their roof, QR code to your website, and a special offer for that neighborhood.

Capture information, not just appointments. If they're not ready, get their email or phone number for follow-up. "Can I send you information about what to look for with your roof type?"

**Digital follow-up sequence:**

Same day: Text message thanking them for their time, with your contact info.

Day 2: Email with educational content about their roof type or local weather concerns.

Day 5: Second text offering a free inspection.

Day 10: Final email with a time-sensitive offer.

This sequence converts people who weren't ready on the doorstep into appointments later. The door knock starts the relationship. The digital follow-up closes it.

## 12. Video Marketing

Video builds trust faster than any other medium. For roofing, it's especially powerful because customers rarely see what actually happens on a job.

**Drone footage.**

Show completed roof jobs from above. This perspective is stunning and showcases your work in a way photos can't. One drone and a $1,500 investment can create content that differentiates you for years.

Before and after drone shots are particularly effective. Show the damaged roof, then the completed installation.

**Process videos.**

Walk through what happens during a roof replacement. What materials do you use? How does your crew operate? What safety measures do you take? This demystifies the process and builds confidence.

**Inspection videos.**

Record your inspections (with permission). Show homeowners the actual damage you found. This transparent approach builds trust and reduces skepticism about your recommendations.

**Post videos everywhere:**

YouTube (for SEO), Facebook, Instagram, your website. A single video can serve multiple platforms.

## 13. Email Marketing for Past Customers

Your past customers are your warmest leads for referrals and repeat business. But most roofers never email them again.

**What to send:**

Quarterly maintenance tips. "5 things to check on your roof this spring." Genuinely helpful content keeps you top of mind.

Annual anniversary emails. "It's been a year since we installed your roof. Here's what to look for." Subtle reminder that you exist.

Storm alerts. "Major storm headed toward [city]. Here's how to prepare your roof." Shows you're proactive and caring.

Referral reminders. Twice a year, remind them about your referral program.

**Keep the list clean.**

Remove bounces, update addresses, honor unsubscribes. A healthy email list has higher engagement and better deliverability.

Tools: Mailchimp's free tier handles most roofing company needs. Move to ConvertKit or ActiveCampaign if you need more automation.

## 14. Direct Mail for Targeted Neighborhoods

Direct mail isn't dead. For roofing, it works when targeted properly.

**Where it works:**

Neighborhoods with aging roofs. Use property data to identify homes built 15-20+ years ago. Their roofs are approaching replacement age.

Storm-affected areas. After a major weather event, blanket affected zip codes with storm damage information.

Recent move-ins. New homeowners often need roof inspections. Target homes that sold in the last 6 months.

**What to send:**

Not generic postcards. Educational content with clear next steps. "Free Guide: Is Your Roof Storm-Ready?" with a QR code to download it from your website (capturing their email).

Lumpy mail for high-value targets. A dimensional package to a homeowner with a 25-year-old roof in an affluent neighborhood gets opened. Cost per piece is higher, but so is response rate.

**Track rigorously.**

Unique phone numbers or landing pages for each campaign. Know exactly which mailers generate calls.

## 15. Strategic Partnerships

Other professionals regularly interact with homeowners who need roof work. Partner with them.

**Real estate agents.**

Roofs kill deals. Agents need reliable roofers who can inspect quickly and provide honest assessments. Become their go-to recommendation. Offer same-day inspections for transactions. They'll send you consistent referral traffic.

**Insurance adjusters.**

Build relationships with local independent adjusters. They can't officially recommend you, but they can mention that "other homeowners in your situation have worked with..." You become the name they mention.

**Home inspectors.**

Home inspectors find roof issues. They can't do the work themselves. Be the company they recommend. Offer them a referral fee or just ensure their clients have a great experience.

**Other contractors.**

Siding companies, gutter installers, solar installers. You encounter the same customers. Cross-refer when it makes sense.

**How to build these relationships:**

Lunch meetings. Buy them lunch, learn their business, explain how you can help their clients. Do this monthly.

Joint marketing. Co-host an educational seminar with a real estate agent. "Home Maintenance for New Homeowners."

Reciprocate. When you encounter clients who need their services, send them referrals. Relationships work both ways.

## Budget Allocation by Business Size

How should you allocate marketing spend? It depends on where you are.

**Under $500k/year revenue:**

Focus on free channels first. Google Business Profile optimization, review generation, referral program, basic website fixes. Paid budget of $1,000-2,000/month max, focused entirely on LSAs.

**$500k-1.5M revenue:**

Max out LSAs. Add $2,000-4,000/month Google Ads budget. Start systematic local SEO. Allocate $500-1,000/month for Facebook retargeting. Total marketing budget: 8-10% of revenue.

**$1.5M+ revenue:**

Full-channel approach. LSAs maxed. Google Ads optimized. Facebook running. [Content marketing](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) for SEO. Video production. Direct mail for targeting. Email nurturing. Partnership development. Total marketing budget: 10-15% of revenue.

## Measuring ROI: Cost Per Lead vs Cost Per Job

Stop looking at cost per click. Start looking at metrics that matter.

**What to track:**

Cost per lead (CPL): Total marketing spend divided by total leads. For roofing, target $50-150 per lead depending on market.

Cost per estimate (CPE): Marketing spend divided by scheduled estimates. This filters out unqualified leads.

Cost per job (CPJ): The real number. Marketing spend divided by closed jobs. For a company with 25% close rate, a $100 CPL becomes $400 CPJ.

Return on marketing investment: Revenue from marketing-attributed jobs divided by marketing spend. Target 5:1 minimum. 10:1 is excellent.

**How to track:**

Call tracking is mandatory. Use CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. Assign unique tracking numbers to each marketing channel.

CRM attribution. Your CRM should capture lead source for every contact. When the job closes, you know which marketing generated it.

Monthly reporting. Create a simple spreadsheet tracking leads, estimates, and closed jobs by source. Update weekly, review monthly, adjust quarterly.

Without this tracking, you're guessing which marketing works. And guessing with a $10,000/month marketing budget is expensive.

## What Actually Matters

Roofing marketing isn't rocket science, but it does require understanding what makes roofing different from other businesses.

The companies that dominate their markets do a few things well: they show up when people search, they have overwhelming social proof, they respond faster than competitors, and they track everything.

The companies that struggle try a little of everything, track nothing, and can't tell you which marketing actually generates jobs.

Pick the strategies from this list that match your budget and capacity. Execute them well. Track the results. Double down on what works.

    title: 'Contractor Marketing Ideas That Actually Work in 2026',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Forget the generic marketing advice. Here are the contractor marketing ideas that actually generate phone calls, backed by data and real implementation details.',
    content: `
Most contractor marketing advice is garbage.

I say this having audited hundreds of marketing setups for roofers, HVAC companies, plumbers, and electricians. The advice floating around online is written by people who've never had to explain to a frustrated contractor why their "content strategy" generated 50 Instagram likes and zero phone calls.

The people writing "10 Marketing Tips for Contractors" have never run a service business. They've never dispatched a crew. They've never sweated a slow season. They're regurgitating the same recycled advice that works for e-commerce stores and SaaS companies, then slapping "for contractors" on the headline.

Here's what actually works, based on spending real money and tracking real results.

## Google Business Profile: Your Actual Most Valuable Marketing Asset

Your website isn't your most important marketing asset. Your Google Business Profile is.

When someone searches "plumber near me" or "emergency roof repair," the map pack shows up first. Before your website. Before your ads. The map pack.

If you're not in those top three spots, you're invisible to the highest-intent searchers in your market.

**What actually moves your GBP ranking:**

Primary category selection matters more than anything else. "Roofing Contractor" outranks "General Contractor" for roofing searches. Get specific.

Complete every single field. Service areas, hours, attributes, services offered. Google rewards completeness. Your competitors skip half of this.

Post weekly. Not because anyone reads them. Because consistent activity signals to Google that your business is alive. We've tested this across dozens of profiles. Weekly posters rank better than identical profiles that don't post.

Photos of real work. Not stock images. Google's AI can tell the difference. Upload before/afters, team photos, and truck photos weekly. Aim for 100+ photos total.

The Q&A section is free keyword optimization. Add your own questions: "Do you offer emergency roof repair?" Answer them yourself with location keywords: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair throughout Dallas and surrounding areas."

Most contractors set up their GBP once and forget it. That's why beating them isn't hard.

## A Review Generation System (Not Just "Ask for Reviews")

"Ask for reviews" isn't a strategy. It's a wish.

A system is a process that runs automatically and produces consistent results. Here's what that looks like:

**The timing:** Send a review request within 2 hours of job completion. Not the next day. Not a week later. While they're still feeling good about the work.

**The medium:** Text message, not email. Text open rates are 98%. Email open rates are 20% on a good day. A direct link to your Google review page, not your Facebook or Yelp.

**The script that works:**

"Hi [Name], thanks for trusting us with your [service type]. If you have 30 seconds, a quick review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"

That's it. No begging. No "it would really mean a lot to us." Just the ask and the link.

**Automate it:** Every job completion in your CRM triggers the text automatically. Jobber, Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan all support this. If your CRM doesn't, Zapier can connect almost anything.

**Response protocol:** Respond to every review within 24 hours. Positive reviews get a quick, personalized thank you. Negative reviews get a professional response acknowledging the issue and offering to make it right. Future customers read your responses more carefully than the reviews themselves.

This system, running consistently, will generate 5-10x more reviews than "asking when you remember."

## Local SEO Fundamentals That Actually Matter

[Local SEO](/services/seo) for contractors isn't complicated. But agencies love making it sound complicated so they can charge more.

Here's what actually moves rankings:

**Service pages that target real searches.** One page per major service. "Roof Replacement in Austin" is a different page than "Roof Repair in Austin." Each page should target specific keywords, answer specific questions, and have unique content. Not 200 words with the city name stuffed in.

**Location pages if you serve multiple cities.** "HVAC Contractor Round Rock" needs its own page. Include driving directions, local landmarks, and specific service details for that area. Google wants to see you're actually serving these locations, not just claiming them.

**NAP consistency everywhere.** Your Name, Address, and Phone number should be identical across your website, Google Business Profile, Yelp, Angi, and every other directory. "123 Main Street" and "123 Main St." are not the same to Google.

**Citations that matter.** Forget the 200-directory "citation building" packages agencies sell. Focus on: Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook, industry-specific directories (Angi, HomeAdvisor, Houzz), and local directories (Chamber of Commerce, BBB if you're a member). That's roughly 15-20 citations that actually move the needle.

**Website speed on mobile.** Over 70% of "near me" searches happen on phones. If your site takes 5 seconds to load, you're losing leads before they see your content. Test with Google PageSpeed Insights. Aim for under 3 seconds.

Most SEO agencies will overwhelm you with technical audits and hundreds of "issues" to fix. 80% of those issues don't matter. The fundamentals above do.

For a deeper dive, read our [complete local SEO guide for contractors](/blog/local-seo-for-contractors).

## Google Ads with Proper Negative Keywords

[Google Ads](/services/paid-advertising) work for contractors. When set up correctly.

The problem: most contractors (or their agencies) set up campaigns with broad match keywords and let Google spend their budget on garbage searches.

"Roofing contractor" on broad match will show your ad for "roofing contractor jobs," "roofing contractor salary," "how to become a roofing contractor," and "roofing contractor license requirements." All people looking for information, not services. All wasted clicks.

**The setup that works:**

Start with exact match and phrase match keywords only. [roofing contractor austin] and "roofing contractor austin" will show for people actually searching for roofing services. Not the tangentially related searches Google wants to waste your money on.

Build your negative keyword list from day one. Check your search terms report weekly for the first month, then monthly after that. Every irrelevant search gets added as a negative. Jobs, salary, DIY, how to, license, near [other cities], free.

Separate campaigns by service and intent. Emergency searches ("emergency roof repair") have different cost-per-click and conversion rates than non-urgent searches ("roof replacement cost"). Don't lump them together.

**Geographic targeting:** Target your actual service area, not the whole metro. A 30-mile radius is probably right. Adding "service area" locations doesn't help.

**Call-only campaigns for high-intent services.** For emergency HVAC, plumbing, or roofing, skip the landing page. Send them straight to a phone call. These leads are ready to book now.

The contractors who do Google Ads well are checking their search terms reports and adding negatives weekly. The contractors who lose money set it and forget it.

## Local Service Ads (LSAs) for Qualified Leads

LSAs show up above regular Google Ads. The "Google Guaranteed" or "Google Screened" badge builds instant trust. And you only pay for actual leads, not clicks.

If you're not running LSAs, start tomorrow.

**The setup:**

Get through Google's verification process. Background checks, license verification, insurance verification. It takes 2-4 weeks. Start now.

Set your budget based on how many leads you can actually handle. LSAs have limited inventory. If you set a high budget, Google won't necessarily spend it all. But they'll fill what demand exists.

Respond to every lead within minutes. LSAs rank providers partly by responsiveness. Slow response = fewer leads shown. Set up instant notifications to your phone.

**The reality check:**

LSAs aren't infinite. You can't just spend more to get more leads. Google only shows them when people search. In most markets, you'll max out LSA inventory and need other channels for growth.

Lead quality varies. You'll get some time-wasters. Track which leads convert to jobs and which don't. Report bad leads to Google (they sometimes credit them back).

LSAs are the highest-intent leads you'll get. Start here before anything else.

## Before/After Photos That Convert

Every contractor thinks they have "great photos." Most don't.

What actually works:

**Consistent angles.** Take the "before" from the same spot as the "after." Standing in the same location, same angle, same framing. Side-by-side comparisons that show the transformation clearly.

**Good lighting.** Natural daylight beats flash every time. If you're inside, open the blinds. If the job finishes after dark, come back in the morning for the final photos.

**Context shots.** The wide shot showing the whole project. The detail shot showing quality of workmanship. The before shot showing how bad it was.

**Organized storage.** Every job gets its own folder. Date, customer name (or address), service type. You should be able to find photos from any job within 60 seconds.

**Where they go:**

Google Business Profile (fresh photos weekly). Your website service pages. Social media. Your CRM attached to customer records. Estimates to show prospects what to expect.

A phone camera is fine. You don't need professional photography. You need consistency and volume.

## Video Testimonials from Real Customers

Written reviews are good. Video testimonials are better.

A real customer, standing in front of the work you did, talking about their experience carries weight that written text can't match. It's proof that's hard to fake.

**How to get them:**

Ask at the end of jobs where customers are clearly happy. Not every customer. The ones who say "this looks amazing" or "I can't believe how fast you finished."

Keep it simple: "Would you mind giving us a 30-second video testimonial? Just say what the problem was and how we helped. Takes less than a minute."

Film on your phone. Horizontal orientation. Decent lighting. Not shaky.

**The questions that work:**

"What was the problem you needed solved?"
"How was your experience working with us?"
"Would you recommend us to others?"

Keep videos under 60 seconds. Long testimonials don't get watched.

**Where to use them:**

Homepage. Service pages (roof replacement page gets roofing testimonials). Google Business Profile as video posts. Facebook and Instagram. YouTube Shorts and TikTok if your audience is there.

Three to five strong video testimonials will outperform pages of written reviews.

## Nextdoor: The Overlooked Platform

Nextdoor is hyper-local. People asking their neighbors for recommendations on home services. High trust, high intent.

**How to work it:**

Claim your business page. Get verified as a local business.

Ask happy customers to recommend you on Nextdoor specifically. When someone posts "looking for a good roofer," their neighbors' recommendations carry serious weight.

Don't spam the neighborhood feed. Contribute useful information. Answer questions about your trade. Be the expert, not the salesperson.

**Neighborhood sponsorship ads:** Nextdoor offers local sponsorship that shows your business in a specific neighborhood's feed. Worth testing with a small budget.

The ROI here is hard to track directly. But in suburban markets especially, Nextdoor recommendations drive significant business.

## Strategic Partnerships with Real Value

Referral partnerships with related trades create recurring lead flow without ongoing ad spend.

**Partnerships that work:**

Roofing + Gutters + Siding. After a roof replacement, the homeowner often needs gutters or siding work. The contractor who did the roof recommending a specific gutter company carries weight.

HVAC + Electrical + Plumbing. New HVAC installation might need electrical work. Plumbing remodels might need HVAC rerouting.

General Contractors + Specialists. GCs need reliable subs they can refer homeowners to for specialized work.

**How to structure it:**

Mutual referral agreement. You send leads to them, they send leads to you. No money changes hands (avoids licensing issues in some states).

Monthly check-ins. Quick call or coffee to maintain the relationship and share what types of jobs you're each looking for.

Clear communication on pricing. Nothing kills a referral partnership faster than your partner's customer complaining about your prices.

**Supplier partnerships:**

The roofing supply house, HVAC distributor, or plumbing wholesaler talks to contractors all day. Some of those contractors get asked for recommendations by homeowners. Be the company suppliers mention.

## A Referral Program With Actual Teeth

"Referral bonus: $50 Visa gift card" doesn't move anyone.

What works: meaningful rewards for meaningful referrals.

**Structure that performs:**

$200-500 for a closed job, not for a lead. Paid within 30 days of job completion. Real money that's worth remembering.

Tiered rewards: $200 for jobs under $5k, $400 for jobs $5-15k, $600 for jobs over $15k. Bigger jobs deserve bigger rewards.

**Make it easy to participate:**

Simple tracking (by name, not by code). "Just tell them Sarah sent you" beats "use referral code SARAH123."

Tell customers about it at job completion. "If you have friends or neighbors who need [service], we pay $300 for referrals that turn into jobs."

Remind past customers quarterly. A text or email to your customer list: "Know someone who needs [service]? We pay $300 for referrals."

**Track obsessively:**

Where did each referral come from? Which customers refer repeatedly? What's your cost per acquisition from referrals vs other channels?

In most markets, referral leads close at 50%+ rates with zero ad spend. Invest accordingly.

## Truck Wraps That Actually Convert

Your trucks are moving billboards you already own. Done right, truck wraps generate calls. Done wrong, they're ignored.

**What works:**

Massive phone number. Readable from 50 feet away. This matters more than anything else.

Clean, simple design. Your logo, phone number, and one line about what you do. That's it. No one's reading paragraphs at 40mph.

High contrast colors. Dark text on light background or vice versa. Low-contrast designs disappear.

Website secondary to phone. URL small at the bottom. Phone number giant.

**What doesn't work:**

Cluttered designs with too much information. Stock photos of smiling technicians. Cute slogans instead of services. Hard-to-read fonts.

**The implementation:**

Use a reputable wrap company. Cheap wraps peel and fade. This is a 5+ year investment.

Full wraps outperform partial wraps. The cost difference is worth it.

Keep trucks clean. A dirty wrapped truck signals "we don't care about details."

Track it: unique phone number on truck wraps so you know what's generating calls from the road.

## Yard Signs Done Right

Basic, but effective when done correctly.

**After every job:**

Ask permission to leave a yard sign for 2-4 weeks. Most customers say yes.

Place at property line, visible from the street, facing traffic flow.

Include: company name, phone number, service completed. "Roof replacement by [Company] | 555-1234"

**High-traffic strategy:**

Ask customers on corner lots or busy streets if you can extend the sign duration. Offer a small discount on future work.

Route your estimates through neighborhoods where you have signs up. "You may have seen our signs on Oak Street."

**Track it:**

Ask how people heard about you. "Saw your sign on [Street]" is free attribution.

Cheap, effective, easy. Most contractors skip it entirely.

## Email to Past Customers

Your existing customer list is underutilized. People who've already paid you money are far more likely to pay you again.

**What to send:**

Seasonal reminders. "Spring is coming - time to check your roof after winter storms." "Summer's almost here - when's the last time you serviced your AC?"

Maintenance offers. Annual HVAC tune-up specials. Gutter cleaning before fall.

New service announcements. "We now offer [service]. As a past customer, you get 15% off."

Referral reminders. "Know someone who needs [service]? We pay $300 for referrals."

**Frequency:**

Once per quarter minimum. Once per month maximum. More than monthly and you become annoying.

**Implementation:**

Collect email addresses on every job. Your CRM should have a field for this.

Use a real email platform (Mailchimp, MailerLite) not your regular inbox. You need to track open rates and stay out of spam folders.

Segment by service. Roofing customers get roofing emails. HVAC customers get HVAC emails.

Email is cheap and effective for repeat and referral business. Most contractors don't do it at all.

## Marketing Ideas That Waste Money

Not everything works. Here's what to avoid:

**Random social media posting.** Posting to Facebook three times a week with no strategy generates nothing. No one's scrolling Instagram looking for a plumber. Unless you're running paid ads with targeting, organic social is brand maintenance at best.

**Cheap SEO packages.** The $299/month SEO agency is submitting your business to spam directories and writing garbage content. You're better off doing nothing. [Real SEO](/services/seo) takes time and expertise. If the price seems too good to be true, it is.

**Lead gen services (Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack).** These can work, but understand what you're buying: shared leads sold to 4-5 competitors simultaneously, often with inflated prices. Calculate your actual cost per closed job, not cost per lead. For many contractors, it's astronomical.

**Billboards.** Unless you're in a very specific situation (highway in your service area, major brand awareness push), billboards are expensive and untraceable. A $3,000/month billboard could fund your entire digital marketing budget.

**Radio/TV for most contractors.** Mass media makes sense when you're trying to reach everyone. Home services usually don't need to reach everyone. They need to reach homeowners in their service area who need their specific service right now. Digital targeting does this better at a fraction of the cost.

Save your money for what works.

## Budget Allocation: How to Prioritize

Your marketing budget determines your strategy, not the other way around.

**$1,000/month plan:**

100% to LSAs and Google Business Profile optimization. Don't split this budget. Concentrate on the highest-ROI channel until you've maxed it out.

Do everything else (review generation, photos, referrals, truck wraps) with time, not money. These cost effort, not dollars.

**$3,000/month plan:**

$1,500 LSAs (or until maxed)
$1,000 Google Search Ads (exact/phrase match, strict negative keywords)
$500 Facebook/Instagram retargeting (people who visited your site but didn't convert)

Plus continued investment in organic: GBP posts, review generation, content for your website.

**$10,000/month plan:**

$3,000 LSAs (likely maxed at this point)
$4,000 Google Search Ads (expanded keywords, geo-targeting tests)
$1,500 Facebook/Instagram (retargeting plus cold audience testing)
$1,500 for professional content, video testimonials, and website improvements

At this level, you should be running incrementality tests. Turn channels off temporarily to measure their true contribution. What happens to lead flow when you pause Facebook? Now you know what it's really worth.

## Measuring What Matters

Marketing without measurement is gambling.

**Track these numbers:**

Leads by source. How many calls, forms, and chats from Google Ads vs LSAs vs organic vs referrals?

Cost per lead by source. Total spend divided by leads.

Estimate rate. What percentage of leads turn into scheduled estimates?

Close rate. What percentage of estimates turn into jobs?

Cost per job by source. This is the number that matters. A channel with expensive leads that close at 80% beats a channel with cheap leads that close at 10%.

Average job value by source. LSA leads might close smaller jobs. Referrals might close bigger ones.

**The monthly report you need:**

One page. Leads, estimates, jobs, revenue, and cost per job by marketing channel. That's it.

If your agency can't produce this report, ask why not. If they give you impressions and reach instead, [read this](/blog/marketing-agency-lying-to-you).

## What to Do Next

This post is 3,000+ words of specific, actionable advice. Most people will read it, nod along, and do nothing.

The contractors who win their markets do the work. They set up the tracking. They optimize their GBP. They build systems for reviews. They check their search terms reports. They ask for referrals. They measure everything.

Pick one thing from this list. Implement it this week. Then pick another.

Or if you want help implementing all of this the right way, [let's talk](/contact). We build marketing systems for contractors that track actual jobs, not vanity metrics. We'll show you exactly where your leads come from and what each one costs.

    title: 'HVAC Marketing: How to Fill Your Schedule Year-Round',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'HVAC businesses face brutal seasonality. Here\'s the complete marketing playbook to generate leads during slow seasons and capture emergency calls when demand spikes.',
    content: `
Most HVAC companies have the same problem: too much work in July and January, tumbleweeds the rest of the year.

I've worked with HVAC contractors who turned away jobs in peak season because they couldn't handle the volume, then laid off technicians three months later. That's not a business model. That's a rollercoaster.

The solution isn't magic. It's systematic marketing that shifts demand, builds recurring revenue, and captures every emergency call when they happen. Here's how to actually do it.

## The HVAC Marketing Challenge

HVAC has three characteristics that break normal marketing rules.

**Extreme seasonality.** Your phone rings off the hook when the first heat wave hits or the first freeze arrives. The rest of the year, you're fighting for scraps. Google Trends data shows "AC repair" searches spike 400% between May and August compared to winter months. That's not a gentle curve. That's a cliff.

**Emergency vs. planned work.** When someone's AC dies at 2pm on a 98-degree Saturday, they're calling whoever answers first. That's a completely different sale than someone researching new HVAC systems for a home they're building. Different intent, different timeline, different marketing approach.

**Maintenance vs. replacement economics.** A $150 tune-up has a completely different customer acquisition cost tolerance than a $12,000 system replacement. Marketing both the same way means you're either overpaying for tune-up leads or underinvesting in replacement opportunities.

Understanding these dynamics shapes everything that follows. Generic [home services marketing](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) advice needs serious modification for HVAC.

## The Seasonal Marketing Calendar

Stop thinking about marketing as a constant. Think about it as a calendar with four distinct campaigns running throughout the year.

### Pre-Summer AC Prep: March Through May

This is your goldmine for planned work. Homeowners aren't desperate yet. You have time to schedule, upsell, and deliver quality service without emergency pressure.

**What to push:** AC tune-ups, maintenance plan signups, system inspections, indoor air quality services.

**The angle:** "Get ahead of summer. Schedule your AC tune-up before the rush." Fear of being stuck without AC when temperatures hit triple digits is real. Use it.

**Ad messaging that works:** "AC tune-ups fill up fast in May. Book now while you can still choose your appointment time." Scarcity works because it's true. Your schedule will be slammed by June.

**Budget allocation:** Increase Google Ads spend by 50% starting March 1st. This is when cost-per-click is still reasonable but intent is building.

We've seen contractors who shift 30% of their summer emergency budget into spring prevention campaigns. The math works: $75 cost-per-lead for a tune-up that converts to a $8,000 system replacement six months later beats $200 cost-per-lead for an emergency call where the customer is price-shopping three companies simultaneously.

### Summer Emergency Response: June Through August

This is survival mode with opportunity. You can't manufacture more leads. You can only capture more of the leads that exist.

**What to push:** 24/7 emergency service, same-day appointments, fast response times.

**The technical setup that matters:** Your website needs to load in under 2 seconds on mobile. When it's 102 degrees and the AC just died, nobody's waiting for your slow site. They're hitting back and calling the next result.

Implement call tracking with whisper messages so your team knows immediately: "This call is from Google Ads - emergency AC repair." That context helps them answer appropriately.

**Ad strategy shifts:**

Increase your LSA budget to maximum. Local Service Ads dominate emergency searches. When someone searches "AC repair near me," LSAs appear above everything else. You want that top spot.

Add "emergency" and "same-day" modifiers to your Google Search campaigns. "Emergency AC repair" has 3x the conversion rate of generic "AC repair" searches, even though it costs more per click.

Enable ad scheduling to increase bids during extreme weather days. If it's 105 degrees, your cost-per-click ceiling should be higher because conversion rates will be higher.

### Fall Heating Prep: September Through November

Mirror image of spring, different system.

**What to push:** Furnace tune-ups, heating system inspections, carbon monoxide safety checks, humidifier installations.

**The angle:** Safety sells better than comfort for heating. "Make sure your furnace is safe before you turn it on" resonates more than "stay warm this winter."

**Timing nuances:** Start heating campaigns right after Labor Day in northern states, late October in southern states. Match your market's weather patterns.

This is also prime time for system replacement sales. Homeowners who struggled through summer with an aging AC are thinking about replacement before winter hits. Target them with "new system" messaging while the pain is fresh.

### Winter Heating Emergencies: December Through February

Same dynamics as summer, different system. Emergency calls spike during cold snaps.

**What to push:** Emergency heating repair, 24/7 service, no overtime charges for nights/weekends (if you can offer that).

**Weather-triggered campaigns:** Set up automated rules in Google Ads to increase budget when local temperatures drop below 20 degrees. This requires daily monitoring or automated scripts, but the ROI is significant.

We built a contractor a simple Google Apps Script that checks weather APIs and adjusts their daily budget automatically. When a cold snap hits, their ads spend more aggressively. When it warms up, they pull back. That script pays for itself every winter.

## Google Business Profile for HVAC

Your Google Business Profile might generate more leads than your website. Treat it accordingly.

**Multiple service categories matter.** HVAC businesses should use: HVAC Contractor (primary), Air Conditioning Contractor, Heating Contractor, Air Conditioning Repair Service, and Furnace Repair Service. Each category helps you appear in different searches.

**Seasonal posts strategy:** Post weekly, but match content to the season.

March-May: AC tune-up reminders, indoor air quality tips, early scheduling benefits.

June-August: Fast response messaging, 24/7 availability, heat safety tips.

September-November: Heating safety checks, furnace efficiency tips, carbon monoxide awareness.

December-February: Emergency heating availability, no overtime messaging, freeze protection tips.

Google's algorithm favors profiles that post consistently. We've tested this extensively. Profiles posting weekly rank higher in the map pack than identical profiles that don't post.

**Q&A optimization for HVAC:** Seed your Q&A section with questions customers actually ask.

"Do you offer 24/7 emergency service?" - Answer with your availability and response time.

"How much does an AC tune-up cost?" - Answer with your pricing or price range.

"Do you service [neighboring city]?" - Answer with your full service area.

"What brands do you install?" - List your brand partnerships.

These Q&As show up in your profile and contain keywords that help you rank. Free SEO that takes 20 minutes to set up.

## Local SEO for HVAC

Beyond Google Business Profile, your website needs location-specific pages that capture searches in every city you serve.

**Service + Location page structure:**

Create pages for each service in each major city. Not thin doorway pages. Actual content.

"AC Repair in [City]" should include: specific neighborhoods you serve in that city, your response time to that area, any local references or completed jobs, and genuinely useful information about AC problems common in that area.

The page for "AC Repair in Phoenix" should mention monsoon season dust affecting condensers. The page for "AC Repair in Minneapolis" should mention preparing systems for temperature swings. Local relevance beats generic content.

**Emergency keyword targeting:**

Build pages specifically for emergency searches. "Emergency AC Repair [City]" and "24 Hour Furnace Repair [City]" are different searches than standard service searches. They deserve dedicated pages.

These pages should emphasize: response time, after-hours availability, phone number prominently displayed, and trust signals (insurance, licensing, reviews). Someone searching at 11pm needs to trust you fast.

**Technical implementation:**

Each location page needs:
- Unique title tag: "AC Repair in [City] | [Company Name]"
- Unique meta description mentioning the city and your key differentiator
- Schema markup with LocalBusiness type and the city's address/service area
- Internal links to your main service pages and other nearby location pages

Proper [SEO implementation](/services/seo) compounds over time. Location pages we built for contractors two years ago still generate leads today without additional ad spend.

## Paid Advertising Strategy for HVAC

[Paid advertising](/services/paid-advertising) for HVAC requires understanding the economics of each service type.

### Google Ads Seasonal Budgets

Here's a budget framework based on what we've seen work:

**Base monthly budget:** Whatever you're comfortable spending during slow months.

**Shoulder seasons (March-May, September-November):** 150% of base. Competition is lower but intent is building.

**Peak seasons (June-August, December-February):** 200-250% of base. Yes, cost-per-click is higher. But conversion rates and job values are also higher.

**Off-peak (the weird in-between weeks):** 75% of base. Maintain presence without bleeding money.

Build this into your annual marketing budget from the start. The contractor who plans for $15,000 in July ad spend doesn't panic when costs spike.

### Local Service Ads for HVAC

LSAs should be your first investment, not your last.

The math: LSAs charge per lead, not per click. For HVAC, that's typically $25-75 per lead depending on your market. A qualified emergency AC lead that converts to a $400 repair job or a $12,000 system replacement? That's exceptional ROI.

**LSA optimization tips:**

Respond to every lead within 5 minutes. Google tracks response time and rewards fast responders with more leads.

Complete every field in your LSA profile. License numbers, insurance verification, service areas. Google shows more complete profiles more often.

Collect reviews specifically to your Google profile. LSA rankings weight review count and recency heavily.

Set your LSA budget high and let Google limit your spend based on lead availability. Unlike Search Ads, you won't waste money on clicks that don't convert.

### Facebook Ads for Maintenance Agreements

Facebook doesn't work for emergency services. Nobody's scrolling Instagram thinking "I should find an emergency HVAC company."

But Facebook excels at maintenance agreement promotion.

**The campaign structure:**

Target: Homeowners in your service area, ages 35-65, with interests in home improvement, home ownership, or specific home-related pages.

Message: "Stop emergency AC repairs before they happen. Our maintenance plan includes two annual tune-ups, priority scheduling, and 15% off repairs. $199/year."

The goal isn't immediate conversion. It's getting people to your landing page and into your remarketing audience. Then you follow up with email, retargeting ads, and phone calls to close the maintenance plan sale.

We've seen contractors build 400+ maintenance agreement customers over 18 months using this approach. That's $80,000+ in predictable annual revenue, plus the system replacement opportunities that come from regular customer contact.

## Building Recurring Revenue Through Marketing

Maintenance plans are the path to schedule stability. Marketing should drive plan signups as aggressively as it drives service calls.

### Maintenance Plan Promotion

**Website placement:** Your maintenance plan should have its own dedicated page with clear pricing, benefits, and signup form. Link to it from every service page.

**Point-of-service promotion:** After every repair call, your technicians should mention the maintenance plan. "This repair was $350. If you'd had our maintenance plan, you'd have gotten 15% off, and we probably would have caught this during your tune-up."

**Seasonal campaigns:** Run maintenance plan promotions in shoulder seasons when you have capacity. "Sign up in March, get your first tune-up free" moves the needle.

### Email Marketing to Existing Customers

Your customer list is gold. Most contractors ignore it.

**Quarterly seasonal emails:**

March: "Summer's coming. Schedule your AC tune-up."
June: "Beat the heat. Our emergency line is available 24/7."
September: "Don't get caught in the cold. Book your furnace inspection."
December: "Thank you for a great year. Here's a special offer for loyal customers."

**Maintenance reminder automation:**

When a customer gets a tune-up, mark the date. 10 months later, send an automated email: "It's almost time for your annual AC tune-up. Click here to schedule."

This is basic email automation. Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or your CRM can handle it. Setup takes an afternoon. The leads it generates are nearly free.

### Seasonal Reminder Campaigns

Text messages work better than email for time-sensitive reminders.

"Hi [Name], this is [Company]. Temperatures are dropping fast this week. Want us to schedule your furnace check before the rush? Reply YES for available times."

We've seen 30%+ response rates on weather-triggered text campaigns. Compare that to 2% email open rates for generic newsletters.

## Website Optimization for HVAC

Your website has specific requirements for HVAC that generic web design ignores.

### Emergency Contact Prominent

When someone's HVAC fails, they're not reading your blog. They're looking for a phone number.

**Implementation requirements:**

Phone number in the header. Visible without scrolling on every page. Click-to-call enabled on mobile.

"Emergency Service" button in the navigation. Bright color. Links to either a phone call or a page with emergency-specific information and a phone number.

Sticky header on mobile that follows the user down the page. The phone number should never disappear.

Live chat or callback widget for users who prefer not to call. Some people want to type "my AC isn't working" rather than explain it verbally.

### Financing Options

HVAC system replacement is a $8,000-15,000 decision. Most homeowners can't write that check casually.

**What to include:**

Dedicated financing page explaining your options (Wells Fargo, GreenSky, Synchrony, whatever you use).

Monthly payment estimates on system replacement pages. "$12,000 system or $189/month for 72 months" is easier to process than a raw price.

"Financing available" messaging on service pages. Even if they're looking at repairs now, knowing financing exists plants a seed for future replacement conversations.

### Service Area Clarity

"We serve the greater metro area" is useless. List specific cities.

Create a service area page with every city and neighborhood you cover. This helps SEO and helps users immediately know if you can help them.

Include a map if possible. Visual confirmation matters.

## Tracking and Attribution

Without proper tracking, you're guessing. And your guesses are probably wrong.

### Call Tracking for Emergency vs. Planned

Different call sources require different handling.

**Setup structure:**

One tracking number for your Google Ads campaigns.
One tracking number for Google Business Profile.
One tracking number for organic website visitors.
One tracking number for Facebook.
Dynamic number insertion on your website that swaps numbers based on traffic source.

**Call categorization:**

Tag calls as emergency vs. scheduled during or after the call. Your phone tracking software (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics) can add tags.

Over time, you'll see patterns. Maybe Google Ads generates 80% emergency calls. Maybe organic traffic generates more scheduled maintenance requests. That data shapes where you spend.

### Lead Source by Season

Build a simple dashboard that shows lead sources by month.

You'll likely discover that certain channels dominate certain seasons. LSAs might generate 60% of your summer leads but only 30% in spring. Organic might provide consistent year-round traffic while paid varies dramatically.

This informs budget allocation. If organic provides your shoulder-season floor, protect your [SEO investment](/services/seo). If LSAs dominate peaks, make sure your profile is optimized before each peak season starts.

**Attribution to closed jobs:**

The real insight comes from tracking which leads become customers.

Integrate your call tracking with your CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber). When a job closes, you should be able to trace it back to the original marketing source.

A $12,000 system replacement that came from organic search has a different value than a $150 tune-up from a Facebook ad. Your marketing decisions should reflect that difference.

## Making This Work

HVAC marketing isn't set-it-and-forget-it. The companies that dominate their markets adjust constantly.

**Weekly tasks:**
- Review call volume and lead sources
- Adjust ad budgets based on weather forecasts
- Post to Google Business Profile
- Respond to reviews

**Monthly tasks:**
- Analyze cost-per-lead by channel
- Review which services are generating the most interest
- Update ad copy for seasonal relevance
- Send customer email campaign

**Quarterly tasks:**
- Full marketing ROI analysis
- Budget reallocation based on performance
- Website content updates for seasonal keywords
- Maintenance plan promotion campaign

**Annually:**
- Set marketing budget by month based on historical performance
- Plan major campaigns for each season
- Review and refresh location pages
- Analyze year-over-year performance

The contractors who build these rhythms into their operations stop having feast-or-famine years. They still have busy seasons and slow seasons. But the extremes flatten out.

## What Comes Next

This is a lot to implement. Most contractors won't do it all. That's fine. Start with what matters most for your situation.

If your phone doesn't ring in spring: Focus on maintenance plan promotion and seasonal email campaigns.

If you're losing emergency calls to competitors: Fix your website speed, LSA optimization, and call response time.

If you don't know what's working: Set up proper tracking first. Every other decision depends on it.

If you want help building this system instead of figuring it out yourself, that's what we do. We've built HVAC marketing programs that generated 40%+ year-over-year growth by systematically addressing each season's opportunities.

    title: 'Local SEO for Contractors: The Complete 2026 Guide',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most contractors are invisible to homeowners searching online. Here\'s the technical playbook to fix that—from Google Business Profile hacks to schema markup that actually moves rankings.',
    content: `
I've watched contractors spend $50,000 on trucks with phone numbers plastered on the side while their Google Business Profile sits empty. The truck reaches maybe 200 people a day. Google reaches everyone in their service area actively searching for what they sell.

Local SEO for contractors isn't the same as local SEO for restaurants or retail stores. You don't have a storefront customers walk into. You serve a geographic area, not a point on a map. Your trust signals matter more because you're asking people to let strangers into their homes.

This guide covers what actually works for service area businesses in 2026. Not theory. Not "best practices" copied from articles about coffee shops. Tested strategies from contractors who went from invisible to booked solid.

## Why Local SEO Is Different for Contractors

Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard local SEO advice often fails contractors.

**You're a service area business, not a storefront.**

Most local SEO guides assume customers will visit your location. For contractors, the opposite is true—you go to them. This changes how Google treats your business and how you should optimize.

Google Business Profile gives you two options: show your address or hide it. If customers don't visit your location, hide it. Showing your garage or home address looks unprofessional and can create security issues. More importantly, it confuses Google about your actual service area.

**Trust is the product.**

Someone hiring a restaurant is risking $50 on a bad meal. Someone hiring a contractor is risking $15,000 and their home's integrity. The trust bar is higher.

Your local SEO strategy needs to account for this. Reviews matter more. Photos matter more. Everything that signals legitimacy and professionalism matters more.

**Competition is hyperlocal.**

You're not competing with every contractor in the country. You're competing with 10-20 other businesses serving your specific area. Understanding exactly who shows up in the map pack for your target searches—and why—is essential.

## Google Business Profile Optimization for Contractors

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is probably worth more than your website for local leads. When someone searches "roofer near me," the map pack shows up first. Your website might not even appear above the fold.

Most contractors set up their profile once and forget it. That's leaving money on the table.

**Primary Category Selection**

This is the single most important field in your profile. Google uses your primary category to determine which searches you're relevant for.

Be specific. "Roofing Contractor" beats "Contractor." "HVAC Contractor" beats "Home Improvement." If Google offers a category that exactly matches your primary service, use it.

Here's what contractors often get wrong: they pick a broad category hoping to rank for more searches. The opposite happens. Google shows more specific businesses first.

**Secondary Categories**

Add every relevant secondary category. A roofing contractor might add: Gutter Cleaning Service, Siding Contractor, Roof Inspection Service. These won't hurt your primary rankings and can help you show up for related searches.

**Service Area Configuration**

For service area businesses, your service area radius directly affects where you rank. Google won't show you in searches from areas you don't serve.

Be honest but strategic. If you'll drive an hour for a good job, include that radius. But if you've defined your service area as the entire state, Google gets confused about where to prioritize showing you.

We typically recommend 20-30 miles for most contractors, adjustable based on your actual willingness to travel. You can list specific cities instead of a radius if that's more accurate.

**Photos That Move the Needle**

Stock photos do nothing. Google knows the difference. Customers know the difference.

What works:

Job site photos showing work in progress. Before and afters. These demonstrate you actually do the work you claim.

Team photos. Real humans in company shirts. Names are optional but helpful. This humanizes your business.

Equipment and trucks. Shows you're legitimate and equipped for the job.

Finished projects that look professional. High quality, well-lit, showcasing your best work.

Upload at least 10 photos to start. Add 2-3 new photos monthly. Google rewards fresh content, and newer photos often display first.

**Posts: The Signal That Matters**

GBP posts rarely generate direct traffic. Almost nobody reads them. So why bother?

Because posting signals to Google that your business is active. We've tested this extensively across dozens of contractor profiles. Regular posting correlates with better map pack rankings.

Post weekly. Content doesn't need to be revolutionary. A completed project, a seasonal tip, a service highlight. Keep it under 300 words with an image.

**Q&A: Free Keyword Optimization**

Here's something most agencies don't tell you: you can ask and answer your own questions on your GBP.

Add questions your customers actually ask, then answer them thoroughly:

Q: "Do you offer emergency roof repair services?"
A: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout [City] and surrounding areas. Call us any time for storm damage, major leaks, or other roofing emergencies."

This puts keywords in your profile that help you rank for those specific searches. Add 5-10 Q&As covering your main services and common customer concerns.

## Review Strategy for Contractors

Reviews are the most visible trust signal in local search. More reviews and higher ratings correlate strongly with map pack rankings and conversion rates.

But the "how" matters as much as the "how many."

**When to Ask**

Timing is everything. Ask immediately after job completion while the customer is still feeling good about the work. Not next week. Not in a follow-up email they'll ignore.

The moment you complete the walkthrough and they express satisfaction, that's the ask. Or within 30 minutes via text.

**How to Ask Without Being Sleazy**

Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, and it undermines the trust reviews are supposed to build.

The script that works:

"Thanks for choosing us for this project. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review really helps other homeowners find us. I can text you the link right now."

Then text the direct review link. Not your website. Not "find us on Google." The actual link that opens the review form.

To get your direct review link, search your business on Google, click your profile, click "Reviews," then click "Write a Review." Copy that URL. Or use a shortlink service to make it cleaner.

**Review Velocity Matters**

Google pays attention to how consistently you generate reviews, not just your total count. A business with 50 reviews that got them all two years ago looks less relevant than a business with 30 reviews that got 3 in the last month.

Build review requests into your post-job process. Every job should include a review ask. Aim for 2-5 new reviews monthly minimum.

**Responding to Negative Reviews**

You'll get negative reviews. Some deserved, some not. Your response matters more than the review itself.

Future customers read your responses carefully. They're looking to see: Are you defensive? Do you blame the customer? Or do you handle criticism professionally?

Response framework:

1. Thank them for the feedback (even if it stings)
2. Acknowledge the issue without admitting fault inappropriately
3. Take the conversation offline: "Please contact us at [phone] so we can make this right."
4. Keep it short and professional

Never argue. Never get defensive. Never reveal private details about the job. The response is for the audience watching, not the angry reviewer.

## Citations That Actually Move the Needle

"Citation building" used to mean getting listed on 500 random directories. That stopped working years ago.

Today, citations matter for two reasons: sending referral traffic and validating your business information to Google. Quality beats quantity.

**The Core 20 That Matter**

Start with these and don't waste time beyond them until they're perfect:

*Aggregators and Data Providers:*
Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook Business

*General Directories:*
Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB (if member), Manta, Foursquare

*Industry-Specific:*
Angi (formerly Angie's List), HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Houzz, Porch, BuildZoom

*Trade-Specific* (varies by industry):
For roofers: RoofingContractor.com, GAF contractor finder
For HVAC: HVAC.com, carrier/brand directories
For plumbers: Plumber.com, trade associations

*Local:*
Chamber of Commerce, local business associations, city directories

**NAP Consistency Is Non-Negotiable**

NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number. These must be identical everywhere. Not similar. Identical.

"123 Main Street Suite 100" and "123 Main St. Ste. 100" are different to Google. Pick one format and use it everywhere.

Audit your existing citations before building new ones. Tools like BrightLocal or Whitespark can help identify inconsistencies. Or do it manually—search your business name and check each listing.

Common mistakes: old addresses that were never updated, multiple phone numbers from call tracking gone wrong, business names that include unnecessary keywords ("Bob's Roofing - #1 Austin Roof Repair").

## On-Page Local SEO

Your website supports your Google Business Profile, not the other way around. But it still needs proper optimization to rank in organic results and convert the traffic GBP sends you.

**Location Page Structure**

If you serve multiple cities, each one gets its own page. "Roofing in Austin" is different from "Roofing in Round Rock." Google treats them as separate search intents.

Structure for location pages:

URL: /roofing/austin or /service-areas/austin

H1: Roofing Contractor in Austin, TX (or similar)

Content: Unique content about serving that specific area. Mention neighborhoods, landmarks, local context. This isn't duplicate content with city names swapped—it's genuinely different pages.

Include: Service list, contact information, reviews from customers in that area if possible, photos from jobs in that area.

The minimum viable location page is about 500 words. Better ones run 800-1,200 with genuine local value.

**Service + Location Combinations**

For larger service areas, create pages for service + location combinations:

/roof-replacement/austin
/roof-repair/round-rock
/emergency-roofing/cedar-park

This captures long-tail searches and gives you more ranking opportunities. A search for "roof repair round rock" will favor a page specifically about roof repair in Round Rock over a generic roof repair page.

Priority: create these for your highest-value services first, then expand based on search volume and competition.

**Schema Markup for Local Business**

Schema is structured data that helps Google understand your business. It's invisible to visitors but important for search.

At minimum, implement LocalBusiness schema on your homepage and location pages. This should include:

- Business name
- Address (or service area)
- Phone number
- Hours
- Service type
- Geographic area served
- Aggregate rating (if you have reviews on your site)

Here's what the JSON-LD should look like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "RoofingContractor",
  "name": "Your Company Name",
  "telephone": "+1-512-555-1234",
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "GeoCircle",
    "geoMidpoint": {
      "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
      "latitude": 30.2672,
      "longitude": -97.7431
    },
    "geoRadius": "30 mi"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "reviewCount": "127"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Use the most specific @type for your business. Google has types for RoofingContractor, Plumber, HVACBusiness, Electrician, and more. Check schema.org for the full list.

Test your schema with Google's Rich Results Test. Fix any errors. Invalid schema can hurt more than help.

## Link Building for Contractors

Links remain one of the strongest ranking factors, but building them for local service businesses works differently than for tech companies or publishers.

**Local Opportunities**

Your existing business relationships are link opportunities:

*Suppliers and distributors:* Many have "find a contractor" or dealer locator pages. If you buy from them, ask about getting listed.

*Manufacturer programs:* GAF, Owens Corning, Carrier, Trane—major manufacturers have contractor networks with website listings.

*Local business associations:* Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, industry-specific groups. Membership often includes a directory listing.

*Partners:* Do you refer work to or receive work from other contractors? Link exchanges between complementary businesses (roofer and gutter installer, HVAC and electrician) are natural and valuable.

**Sponsorships That Pass Value**

Sponsoring little league teams is great for community relations. But does it help SEO?

Only if you get a link from a website with real authority. The $500 banner at the baseball field does nothing for Google. The $500 sponsorship that gets you a do-follow link from the school district's website? That moves the needle.

Look for sponsorship opportunities that include website mentions: local events, charity runs, school programs, community organizations. Ask specifically about website recognition, not just logo placement on physical materials.

**Content That Earns Links Naturally**

Contractors rarely do content marketing well, which means opportunity for those who do.

Create local resources people actually want to link to:

- "How to Prepare Your [City] Home for Hurricane Season"
- "Average Cost of [Service] in [City]: 2026 Data"
- "Complete Guide to [City] Building Permits for [Project Type]"

Local journalists and bloggers link to useful local resources. Generic "5 Tips for Hiring a Roofer" content gets ignored.

For a deeper dive into content strategy for contractors, our [home services marketing guide](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) covers this extensively.

## Tracking Local SEO Success

You can't improve what you can't measure. Most contractors have no idea if their SEO is working.

**Google Business Profile Insights**

Your GBP dashboard shows: search queries that triggered your listing, views, direction requests, phone calls, website clicks.

This data is directional, not perfect. Google aggregates and sometimes delays it. But month-over-month trends tell you if you're moving up or down.

Key metrics to track monthly:
- Total searches your profile appeared in
- Direct searches (people searching your business name)
- Discovery searches (people searching for what you offer)
- Phone calls from profile
- Website visits from profile
- Direction requests

**Rank Tracking by Location**

Where you rank depends on where the searcher is located. Someone in downtown Austin sees different results than someone in Round Rock, even for the same search.

Use a rank tracking tool that checks from multiple locations in your service area. BrightLocal, LocalFalcon, and GeoRanker all do this. They'll show you a grid of your rankings across different points in your territory.

Track your main keywords weekly. Look for patterns: strong in some areas, weak in others. This tells you where to focus optimization.

**Call Tracking Attribution**

If you're not tracking which marketing generates which phone calls, you're guessing.

Use a call tracking service (CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, WhatConverts) to assign unique phone numbers to different channels. Your GBP listing gets one number. Your website organic traffic gets another (via dynamic insertion). Your paid ads get another.

Now you know: "Last month, 47 calls from GBP, 23 from organic search, 12 from Google Ads."

One caution: too many tracking numbers can create NAP inconsistency issues. Use dynamic number insertion on your website rather than hard-coding multiple numbers.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

After working with dozens of contractors on local SEO, the same mistakes show up repeatedly.

**Hiding the address when customers can visit.**

If you have a showroom or office customers can come to, show your address. Hiding it makes you look illegitimate and limits your ranking potential.

**Service area too broad or too narrow.**

Too broad (entire state) and Google doesn't know where to show you. Too narrow (one zip code) and you miss opportunities. Match it to your actual service willingness.

**Keyword stuffing the business name.**

"Bob's Roofing | Best Austin Roofing Company | Emergency Roof Repair" isn't your business name. Google knows it, and this can get your listing suspended. Use your actual business name only.

**Ignoring profile completeness.**

Every empty field is a missed opportunity. Fill out services, attributes, hours, Q&A, photos—all of it.

**One-and-done mindset.**

GBP isn't "set it and forget it." Regular updates, fresh photos, new reviews, and weekly posts signal an active business.

## Next Steps

Local SEO for contractors comes down to a few fundamentals: a fully optimized Google Business Profile, consistent NAP across quality citations, a review generation system, and a website that supports it all.

The contractors who dominate the map pack in their area do these basics consistently. They don't chase shortcuts. They build the machine and keep it running.

    excerpt: 'Service businesses face unique measurement challenges: phone calls, long sales cycles, and offline conversions. Here\'s the developer-led approach to tracking what actually matters.',
    content: `
Most businesses measure marketing ROI wrong. Service businesses measure it completely wrong.

The problem isn't math. The formula is simple: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost. Any spreadsheet can handle that.

The problem is getting accurate numbers to plug into the formula. For service businesses, that's brutally hard.

An e-commerce company knows exactly which ad generated which sale. Click, purchase, done. You run a roofing company? Someone might find you on Google, call three weeks later, schedule an estimate, think about it for a month, then sign a contract. Good luck attributing that cleanly.

This guide breaks down how to actually measure marketing ROI when your business doesn't fit the standard playbook. It's technical in places because the solutions are technical. That's the point.

## Why Marketing ROI Is Harder for Service Businesses

Let's be honest about what you're up against.

**Long sales cycles destroy simple attribution.** A homeowner researches HVAC companies for weeks before calling anyone. They might visit your site five times from different devices. When they finally call, which visit gets credit? Most tracking systems will say "direct traffic" because too much time passed since their first click.

**Phone calls are a black hole.** For most service businesses, 60-80% of leads come through phone calls. Standard Google Analytics doesn't track phone calls at all. You're measuring 20% of your leads and pretending it's 100%.

**Offline conversions matter most.** The lead isn't the goal. The signed contract is. But most businesses can't connect their marketing data to their actual closed jobs. They optimize for leads, not revenue.

**Multi-touch journeys are the norm.** Your customer might see a Facebook ad, search for you on Google two weeks later, read a blog post, then call after seeing your truck in their neighborhood. Every touchpoint mattered. None of them get full credit.

If your marketing reports can't account for these realities, you're making budget decisions based on incomplete data. That's expensive.

## Metrics That Matter vs. Vanity Metrics

Let's separate signal from noise.

**Vanity Metrics (Stop Reporting These)**

Impressions. Your ad appeared on a screen. So what? A billboard has impressions too.

Click-through rate. Higher is better, but a 5% CTR that generates zero jobs is worse than a 1% CTR that generates fifty.

Social media followers. Unless you're monetizing influence, follower count is a distraction.

Website traffic. More traffic means nothing if it doesn't convert. I've seen businesses triple their traffic while their lead count stayed flat.

**Metrics That Actually Matter**

Cost per lead. Total marketing spend divided by total leads. This is your baseline.

Cost per qualified lead. Same calculation, but only counting leads that meet basic criteria: in your service area, need a service you offer, have budget authority. This is more useful than raw cost per lead.

Cost per estimate/appointment. How much are you spending to get someone on the schedule? This matters for service businesses where the estimate is a critical conversion point.

Cost per job. Total marketing spend divided by closed jobs. This is the metric most businesses can't calculate but desperately need.

Customer lifetime value (LTV). What's a customer worth over their entire relationship with you? An HVAC customer who comes back for maintenance and eventually buys a new system is worth far more than a one-time repair.

Marketing-attributed revenue. Total revenue from jobs that originated from marketing activities. When you can calculate this, you can calculate true ROI.

For most service businesses, the goal should be moving from "we know cost per lead" to "we know cost per job." That single improvement can transform how you allocate budget.

## Setting Up Proper Tracking: The Developer Angle

This is where most guides get vague. I'm going to get specific because [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics) is foundational to everything else.

**GA4 Configuration for Service Businesses**

Standard GA4 setup is nearly useless for service businesses. It tracks pageviews. You need it to track business outcomes.

Here's what to configure:

Phone click tracking. Every click on a tel: link should fire an event. The code is straightforward:

Add an event listener to all phone links that sends a custom event to GA4 with parameters for the page URL, traffic source, and phone number clicked. Ten lines of JavaScript. But almost nobody does it.

Form submission tracking with source attribution. Don't just track "form submitted." Track the full context: which form, which page, what traffic source brought them there, what campaign if any.

Scroll depth events. Someone who reads 75% of your roofing page is a warmer prospect than someone who bounced after 3 seconds. Create threshold events at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.

Session duration by page type. How long do people spend on your service pages versus your blog? This tells you which content is actually engaging.

Enhanced conversions. If you're running Google Ads, enable enhanced conversions. This lets you pass hashed customer data back to Google for better attribution.

**Call Tracking Implementation**

This is non-negotiable for service businesses. You need to know which marketing generates which phone calls.

The setup: Use a call tracking service (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics). Create unique tracking numbers for each marketing channel.

Your Google Ads get one number. Your organic website traffic sees a dynamically inserted number based on their traffic source. Your Google Business Profile gets another number. Direct mail gets another.

Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) is the key feature. When someone lands on your website from a Google organic search, they see a different phone number than someone who came from Facebook. The call tracking system logs which source generated each call.

Integration with GA4: Your call tracking platform should push call data back to Google Analytics as events. Now you can see calls alongside your other conversion data in one place.

One technical note: Don't create dozens of static tracking numbers for different pages or campaigns. This creates NAP (Name, Address, Phone) inconsistency issues that hurt local SEO. Use DNI for your website and limit static tracking numbers to offline channels and third-party platforms.

**Form Tracking That Works**

Every form submission should capture:

- Which form (contact, quote request, service-specific)
- Which page the form was on
- Traffic source/medium/campaign
- Any hidden fields with UTM parameters
- Timestamp

Push all of this to GA4 and your CRM simultaneously. If your form only sends an email notification, you've already lost data.

**CRM Integration for Closed-Loop Reporting**

This is where [analytics tracking](/services/analytics) goes from good to transformational.

The goal: connect your marketing data to your closed jobs. When you sign a $15,000 contract, you should be able to trace it back to exactly which marketing brought that customer in.

The technical approach:

1. When a lead comes in (call or form), capture their marketing attribution data.
2. Create or update the contact in your CRM with that attribution data attached.
3. As the lead progresses through your pipeline (estimate scheduled, proposal sent, job won), that marketing attribution stays with them.
4. When the job closes, you can report revenue back to the marketing source.

For Google Ads, this means implementing offline conversion tracking. You pass the GCLID (Google Click ID) from the ad click through your entire funnel, then upload completed jobs with their GCLID back to Google Ads. Now Google knows which keywords and campaigns generate actual revenue, not just leads.

The CRMs that do this well: ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro have reasonable attribution features built in. Jobber is getting better. For custom integrations, Zapier or Make can connect most systems.

Is this setup work? Yes. Is it worth it? A client recently discovered their highest-volume lead source had the lowest close rate and smallest average job size. Their lowest-volume source had 3x the close rate and 2x the job size. Without closed-loop reporting, they would have doubled down on the wrong channel.

## Attribution Models for Service Businesses

Attribution is how you decide which marketing touchpoint gets credit for a conversion. For service businesses, this gets messy fast.

**First-Touch Attribution**

Credit goes to whatever marketing first brought the customer to you. They searched "roof repair austin," clicked your ad, and called three weeks later after visiting four more times? The first ad click gets 100% credit.

Pros: Simple. Good for understanding what drives awareness.

Cons: Ignores everything that happened between first touch and conversion. Overvalues top-of-funnel.

**Last-Touch Attribution**

Credit goes to the final interaction before conversion. They came from organic search, saw three retargeting ads, then called after clicking an email link? Email gets 100% credit.

Pros: Simple. Good for understanding what closes deals.

Cons: Ignores everything that built the relationship. Undervalues awareness and nurturing.

**Multi-Touch Attribution**

Credit is distributed across all touchpoints in the journey. Linear attribution splits credit equally. Time-decay gives more credit to touchpoints closer to conversion. Position-based (U-shaped) gives 40% to first touch, 40% to last touch, and 20% distributed across the middle.

Pros: More realistic view of the customer journey.

Cons: Harder to implement. Requires complete tracking across all touchpoints.

**Why Phone Calls Complicate Everything**

Here's the technical problem: phone calls break the digital trail.

Someone clicks your Google Ad, lands on your website, then picks up their phone and calls. Unless you have call tracking with proper attribution, you just lost the connection between that ad click and the call.

Even with call tracking, you might not match the call to the specific website session. The customer might call from a different phone than the one they browsed on. They might call days later.

This is why service business attribution will never be as clean as e-commerce. The best you can do is: implement call tracking, use dynamic number insertion, capture as much session data as possible, and accept that some attribution will be "best guess."

**Practical Attribution for Small Businesses**

If you're a local service business spending less than $10k/month on marketing, don't overthink attribution models.

Start here:

1. Track all leads by source (where did they say they heard about you? + call tracking data + form attribution data).
2. Track all closed jobs back to their original lead source.
3. Calculate cost per job by source.
4. Allocate budget toward sources with lowest cost per job and highest job value.

That's it. You don't need a sophisticated multi-touch model until you have the basics working.

## Building a Marketing Dashboard

Reports are useless if nobody looks at them. A dashboard that updates automatically and answers specific questions is worth a hundred PDFs.

**What to Include**

Lead volume by source. How many leads came from Google Ads, organic search, Google Business Profile, Facebook, referrals, etc.?

Lead quality by source. What percentage of leads from each source became estimates? What percentage became jobs?

Cost per lead by source. What are you paying for each lead from each channel?

Cost per job by source. The metric that matters most.

Revenue attribution. How much revenue did marketing generate?

Trend lines. Are things getting better or worse? Month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons.

**Tools That Work**

Google Looker Studio (free) connects directly to GA4, Google Ads, and Google Sheets. For most service businesses, this is enough.

Create a data pipeline: Your call tracking and CRM data exports to Google Sheets (via Zapier or native integrations). Looker Studio pulls from Sheets and GA4. You get a live dashboard.

Alternatively, Databox or AgencyAnalytics are solid paid options with more pre-built connectors.

**Update Frequency**

Real-time dashboards are overrated for most businesses. The data doesn't change that fast, and you don't have time to stare at screens all day.

Weekly updates work for most metrics. Monthly deep-dives for trend analysis and budget decisions. Quarterly reviews for strategic changes.

Set a calendar reminder to actually look at the dashboard. Data you never review is data you wasted time collecting.

## ROI Calculation Framework

Now for the actual math.

**The Basic Formula**

Marketing ROI = (Revenue Attributed to Marketing - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost x 100

If you spent $5,000 on marketing and generated $25,000 in revenue from marketing-attributed jobs:

ROI = ($25,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 x 100 = 400%

For every dollar spent, you got four dollars back. That's a healthy return.

**Accounting for Lag Time**

Here's where service businesses differ from e-commerce. Your ROI calculation needs to account for sales cycle length.

If your average time from first touch to closed job is 45 days, you can't judge January's marketing spend by January's revenue. You need to judge it by February and March's revenue.

Create cohort-based analysis. Take all leads from January. Track them for 90 days (or whatever your typical max sales cycle is). Calculate revenue generated by that cohort. Now you can accurately calculate January's marketing ROI.

**Seasonal Adjustments**

For HVAC, roofing, and other seasonal businesses, comparing raw month-to-month numbers is misleading.

Compare year-over-year instead. January 2026 vs. January 2025. This controls for seasonality.

If you want month-over-month insights, use seasonality indexes. If January typically represents 5% of annual revenue and July represents 15%, weight your expectations accordingly.

**The Blended vs. Channel-Specific View**

Calculate both.

Blended marketing ROI gives you the overall picture: is your total marketing spend generating profitable returns?

Channel-specific ROI tells you where to adjust: Google Ads might have 500% ROI while Facebook has 80%. Shift budget accordingly.

A warning: don't just chase the highest-ROI channel. Some channels have limited scale. Your LSAs might have 1000% ROI, but you can only get so many leads from them. The next-best channel might be necessary for growth even if its ROI is lower.

## Common Measurement Mistakes

I've audited hundreds of marketing setups. These are the mistakes I see repeatedly.

**Counting Leads, Not Jobs**

Your marketing generated 100 leads. Great. How many became jobs?

If Channel A generates 50 leads and 10 jobs, and Channel B generates 20 leads and 15 jobs, Channel B is better even though it generated fewer leads.

Leads are not the goal. Revenue is the goal. Optimize accordingly.

**Ignoring Customer Quality**

A lead for a $500 repair and a lead for a $20,000 system replacement are not the same. Your ROI calculations need to weight job value.

If all your Google Ads leads are small repairs and all your referral leads are major projects, raw cost-per-lead comparisons are meaningless.

Calculate revenue per lead by source. This accounts for quality differences.

**Short Measurement Windows**

You ran Google Ads for 60 days, got 15 leads, and declared it a failure.

But your average sales cycle is 45 days. Half those leads are still in the pipeline. You're evaluating an incomplete dataset.

Extend your measurement window to at least 1.5x your average sales cycle before making channel decisions.

**Not Accounting for Lifetime Value**

A new customer costs you $300 to acquire. Their first job nets you $200 profit. Bad ROI, right?

But that customer comes back for three more jobs over five years, totaling $2,000 in profit. Now that $300 acquisition cost looks brilliant.

For repeat-service businesses (HVAC maintenance, regular landscaping, property management), LTV changes everything about how you evaluate marketing.

**Attributing Poorly Tracked Leads to "Direct"**

If your tracking breaks at any point, the lead typically gets attributed to "direct" or "none." Over time, your "direct" traffic balloons.

If direct traffic is growing faster than your business, that's a data quality problem, not a marketing win. Audit your tracking.

## What to Do When You Can't Measure Perfectly

Perfect measurement is impossible. Customers use multiple devices. Some touchpoints happen offline. Some attribution will always be estimated.

Here's how to make good decisions with imperfect data.

**Directional Indicators**

You might not know the exact ROI of a channel, but you can identify directional trends.

Is cost per lead going up or down? Is lead volume from this source growing or shrinking? Are close rates from this source improving or declining?

Directional data is often enough for budget decisions. If every metric for a channel is trending in the wrong direction, cut the budget. If everything's improving, consider increasing it.

**A/B Testing for Clarity**

When you can't measure something directly, test it.

Pause a campaign for 30 days and see what happens to lead flow. Run a promo in only half your service area and compare results. Send one version of an email to half your list and another version to the other half.

Controlled experiments give you clearer signal than multi-variate mess.

**Customer Surveys**

Sometimes the simplest approach works: ask customers how they found you.

Add a required field to your intake form or phone script. Track the responses. Yes, customers sometimes get it wrong or simplify ("Google" when they actually saw a Google Ad). But aggregate data from customer surveys often reveals channel performance that digital tracking misses.

**Incrementality Testing**

The advanced version of A/B testing. You run a channel in some markets but not others (or run it at different spend levels), then compare results between the groups.

This isolates the true incremental impact of a channel. Did Google Ads actually generate more revenue, or did it just take credit for customers who would have found you anyway?

For larger budgets ($10k+/month per channel), incrementality testing should be part of your optimization strategy.

## The Bottom Line

Measuring marketing ROI for service businesses requires more work than the standard playbook allows.

You need tracking that captures phone calls, forms, and offline conversions. You need systems that connect marketing data to closed jobs. You need analytics configured for your actual business model. And you need to accept that some measurement will always be imperfect.

The alternative is flying blind. Making budget decisions based on which agency sends the nicest-looking report. Optimizing for leads when you should be optimizing for revenue. Cutting channels that work and doubling down on channels that don't.

The technical foundation matters. That's why [our approach to analytics](/services/analytics) starts with measurement architecture before we ever talk about campaigns.

Most marketing agencies don't want to do this work. It's harder than running ads and sending vanity metric reports. But it's the only way to actually know what's working.

    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most marketing advice is written for tech startups and e-commerce. Here\'s what actually moves the needle for roofers, HVAC contractors, and home service businesses.',
    content: `
Everything you've read about marketing is probably wrong for your business.

I've spent years watching contractors burn through marketing budgets following advice meant for software companies. A roofing company isn't a SaaS startup. An HVAC contractor isn't selling shoes online. The playbook is different.

This guide is what I wish existed when I started working with home service businesses. No fluff. No "build your brand" nonsense. Just what actually generates jobs.

## Why Generic Marketing Advice Fails Home Services

Here's the fundamental problem: most marketing content is written by people who've never had to explain to a frustrated business owner why their $5,000 ad spend generated lots of "engagement" but zero phone calls.

Home services marketing has unique constraints that break standard advice:

**The lead-to-job gap is massive.** A software company counts a form submission as a conversion. You count a signed contract after an in-person estimate. That's two completely different games.

**Geography limits everything.** You can't scale by reaching more people. You scale by converting more of the people in your service area. A viral post doesn't help when your trucks only drive 30 miles.

**Seasonality hits hard.** HVAC companies live and die by weather. Roofers watch insurance adjusters like farmers watch rain. Your marketing can't pretend this doesn't exist.

**Trust is the product.** You're asking someone to let strangers into their home and write a check for $8,000. That requires a different kind of persuasion than selling a $50 product online.

The advice that follows accounts for all of this.

## The Foundation: Tracking That Actually Works

I'm putting this first because nothing else matters without it. I've audited hundreds of contractor marketing setups. Maybe 5% had tracking that could actually tell them which marketing generated which jobs.

Most have Google Analytics installed. Almost none have it configured to measure what matters.

**GA4 Setup That Works for Services**

Standard GA4 tracks page views. Useless. You need it tracking what matters for [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics):

Phone call clicks from your website. This requires setting up event tracking for tel: links. If your developer tells you this is hard, get a new developer. It's 10 lines of code.

Form submissions with source attribution. Not just "form submitted" but "form submitted by someone who found us through Google organic search for 'roof repair austin'."

Scroll depth on service pages. If someone reads 75% of your roofing page, they're a warmer lead than someone who bounced after 3 seconds. Treat them differently.

Here's the GA4 event setup you actually need:

Create custom events for: phone_click, form_submit, chat_initiated, and quote_request. Tag each with the traffic source, landing page, and service category. This takes about two hours to set up properly. Those two hours will save you from making $50,000 in bad marketing decisions.

**Call Tracking Implementation**

This is where most contractors lose the plot entirely.

You need a call tracking system. CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, WhatConverts—pick one. They all work. The point is getting a unique phone number for each marketing channel so you know what's generating calls.

The setup: Your Google Ads get one tracking number. Your organic search traffic sees a different number on your website (dynamic number insertion). Your Google Business Profile gets another. Your Facebook ads get another.

Now when someone calls, you know exactly which marketing brought them in. Revolutionary, right? Yet 90% of contractors I talk to have no idea which of their marketing channels actually generate phone calls. They're just guessing.

One warning: don't use too many tracking numbers or you'll dilute your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency for local SEO. Use dynamic number insertion on your website instead of hard-coding multiple numbers.

**Attribution That Connects to Closed Jobs**

Here's where [proper attribution](/services/analytics) gets into territory most marketing guides won't touch because it requires actual work.

Your marketing attribution is worthless if it stops at "lead generated." The lead that turned into a $15,000 job matters more than the ten leads that ghosted you.

The fix: your CRM needs to talk to your marketing data.

This means either using a CRM that integrates with your call tracking and analytics (Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan, Jobber all have varying levels of this), or building the connection yourself. We've built custom integrations using Zapier and webhooks that push closed job data back to Google Analytics and ad platforms.

When you close a job, you should be able to trace it back to: which keyword they searched, which ad they clicked, which page they landed on, and which phone number they called. This is table stakes for making smart budget decisions.

Without this, you're optimizing for leads. With it, you're optimizing for revenue.

## Local SEO: The 80/20 That Moves the Needle

I could write 50,000 words on [local SEO](/services/seo). But you don't need 50,000 words. You need to know what actually matters and what's a waste of time.

**Google Business Profile Optimization**

Your Google Business Profile is probably your single most important marketing asset. Not your website. Not your ads. The thing that shows up when someone searches "roofer near me."

Here's what actually moves rankings:

Primary category matters most. Pick the most specific category that matches your primary service. "Roofing Contractor" beats "Contractor." "HVAC Contractor" beats "Home Services."

Complete every field. Hours, services, service area, attributes—all of it. Google rewards completeness. This takes 30 minutes and most competitors skip it.

Photos that aren't stock images. Real job photos, team photos, truck photos. Before and afters of actual work you did. Google can tell the difference between stock photos and real ones. So can customers.

Posts every week. Not because anyone reads them—they don't. Because consistent posting signals to Google that your business is active. We've tested this extensively. Profiles that post weekly rank better than identical profiles that don't.

Q&A optimization. Add your own questions and answers with keywords in them. "Do you offer emergency roof repair?" "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout Austin and surrounding areas." It's free keyword optimization most competitors ignore.

**Reviews: Strategy Without Sleaze**

More reviews generally means better rankings and more conversions. But the "how" matters.

Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, it's transparent to customers, and it undermines trust. One negative "this company paid me to write this" review can tank your conversion rate.

Instead: make leaving a review stupidly easy.

Send a text with a direct link to your Google review page immediately after job completion, while they're still feeling good about the work. Not an email buried in their inbox. A text. The tap-to-review rate on texts is 10x higher than email.

The script that works: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review helps other homeowners find us: [link]" That's it. No begging. No "it would really mean a lot." Just the ask and the link.

Respond to every review. Positive: quick thanks. Negative: professional response that acknowledges the issue and offers resolution. Future customers read your responses more carefully than the reviews themselves.

**Citations That Matter vs. Waste of Time**

"Citation building" used to be a thing. Agencies would charge thousands to get you listed on 200 directories nobody's ever heard of.

Most of that is worthless now. Here's what actually matters:

The big four: Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook. Get these right first.

Industry-specific directories: Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Houzz, and industry-specific directories for your trade. These actually send traffic.

Local directories: Your local Chamber of Commerce, BBB if you're a member, local business associations.

That's roughly 15-20 citations that actually matter. Beyond that, you're chasing diminishing returns. Don't let an agency convince you that your 47th directory listing is moving the needle.

The key across all citations: NAP consistency. Your name, address, and phone number should be identical everywhere. Not similar. Identical. "123 Main Street" and "123 Main St." are not the same to Google.

## Paid Advertising: Where to Actually Spend

Everyone wants to know: Google Ads or Facebook? LSAs or display? Here's the honest breakdown based on spending millions of dollars across home service clients.

**Google Ads vs. LSAs vs. Facebook**

Understanding the differences between [paid advertising channels](/services/paid-advertising) is critical. Local Service Ads (LSAs) have the highest intent. When someone searches "emergency plumber" and calls directly from the LSA, they need a plumber right now. LSAs work on a pay-per-lead model, so you only pay when someone actually contacts you.

The catch: LSAs have limited inventory. You can't just spend more to get more leads. Google shows them based on proximity, reviews, and responsiveness. Max out LSAs first, then look elsewhere.

Google Search Ads capture high-intent searches that LSAs don't cover. Someone searching "best roofing company austin" or "hvac installation cost" is actively shopping. These leads are more expensive but convert well.

The key with Search Ads: ruthless negative keyword management. You'll blow through budget fast on worthless searches like "roofing jobs" (people looking for employment) or "diy roof repair" if you don't actively exclude them.

Start with exact match and phrase match keywords only. Broad match is a budget incinerator for home services. Google will gleefully spend your money on tangentially related searches.

[Facebook and Instagram ads](/services/paid-advertising) work differently. Lower intent, lower cost per click, higher volume. Nobody's on Facebook looking for a roofer. But you can reach people who might need one.

Facebook works best for: high-value services with longer consideration cycles (new HVAC systems, bathroom remodels), brand building in your service area, and retargeting people who visited your website but didn't convert.

Facebook doesn't work for: emergency services, low-ticket repairs, time-sensitive needs.

**Budget Allocation by Business Stage**

If you're spending under $3,000/month total on advertising:

Put 100% into LSAs until you've maxed them out, then move to Google Search. Don't split your budget across platforms. Concentration beats diversification when you're small.

If you're spending $3,000-10,000/month:

60% Google (LSAs + Search), 30% Facebook/Instagram for retargeting and high-value services, 10% testing new channels.

If you're spending $10,000+/month:

Now you can test properly. 50% to proven channels, 25% to expansion, 25% to experiments. At this budget, you should be running incrementality tests to verify each channel's true contribution.

**The Metrics That Matter**

Stop looking at:
- Cost per click
- Click-through rate
- Impressions
- Reach

Start looking at:
- Cost per qualified lead (someone who actually wants your service in your area)
- Cost per estimate (leads that became appointments)
- Cost per job (the actual metric that matters)
- Return on ad spend (revenue generated divided by ad cost)

A campaign with $50 cost per click that generates $12,000 jobs beats a campaign with $5 cost per click that generates tire-kickers every time.

## Content & Website Optimization

Your website exists to convert visitors into leads. That's it. Everything else is secondary. This is where [conversion rate optimization](/services/cro) becomes essential.

**Pages That Convert for Service Businesses**

You need these pages, optimized for both search and conversion:

Homepage: Clear value proposition, primary service areas, trust signals (reviews, certifications, years in business), and obvious contact options. Don't bury the phone number.

Individual service pages: One page per major service. Not a generic "services" page. "Roof Replacement" gets its own page. "Roof Repair" gets its own page. "Storm Damage Repair" gets its own page. Each page targets specific keywords and addresses specific concerns.

Location pages: If you serve multiple cities, each city gets a page. "Roofing Contractor in Round Rock" is a different page than "Roofing Contractor in Cedar Park." Yes, it's more work. Yes, it matters.

About/Team page: Real photos of real people. Bios that establish credibility. This is where you build the trust that converts browsers into callers.

Reviews/testimonials page: Aggregated proof that you do good work. Embed your Google reviews, add photos of completed projects, include video testimonials if you have them.

**The One Thing Most Contractor Websites Get Wrong**

Buried contact information.

I've seen contractor websites where you have to scroll through three screens of content to find a phone number. I've seen sites where "Contact Us" is a tiny link in the footer. I've seen sites where the only way to reach the company is through a contact form hidden on a separate page.

Your phone number should be visible without scrolling on every page. Click-to-call on mobile. Sticky header with contact info that follows the user.

People searching for home services often have urgent needs. Make it stupidly easy to call you. If someone lands on your site and can't immediately figure out how to contact you, they're gone.

Secondary to this: your mobile experience matters more than desktop. Over 70% of local searches happen on phones. If your site is slow or clunky on mobile, you're hemorrhaging leads.

## Marketing Automation Without Enterprise Tools

ServiceTitan costs $500+/month. HubSpot enterprise is thousands. You don't need either to automate your marketing.

**Practical Workflows Using Accessible Tools**

The goal is simple: no lead should fall through the cracks because someone forgot to follow up.

Stack we recommend for sub-$200/month:

CRM: Housecall Pro or Jobber ($50-100/month). Both handle scheduling, invoicing, and basic automation.

Email automation: Mailchimp or MailerLite free tiers get you started. ConvertKit if you need more sophistication.

Text automation: TextMagic or SimpleTexting ($25-50/month). Critical for lead response speed.

Integration glue: Zapier ($20-50/month). Connects everything.

**Lead Follow-Up Sequences That Work**

When a lead comes in—whether from a form, call, or chat—this sequence should fire automatically:

0-5 minutes: Automated text confirming receipt. "Thanks for reaching out about [service]. Someone from our team will contact you within the hour."

5-15 minutes: Phone call from your team. Speed-to-lead is everything. The contractor who calls first gets the job 70%+ of the time.

Same day: If no answer, follow-up text. "Hi [Name], tried calling about your [service] request. When's a good time to reach you?"

Day 2: Another call attempt + email with helpful information about the service they requested.

Day 4: "Checking in" text. Low pressure.

Day 7: Final "want us to close your request?" message.

This entire sequence can be automated with the tools above. Your job is just making the phone calls. Everything else runs itself.

The mistake I see: contractors who respond to leads within 2-3 days. By then, the customer has already scheduled with two other companies. Speed is your competitive advantage.

## Measuring What Matters

At this point, you're tracking properly, generating leads from multiple channels, and following up automatically. Now you need to make sense of it all.

**ROI Calculation Framework**

Monthly marketing ROI shouldn't be complicated. Here's the spreadsheet you need:

For each marketing channel, track:
- Total spend (ads + tools + agency fees)
- Leads generated
- Estimates scheduled
- Jobs closed
- Revenue from those jobs

Then calculate:
- Cost per lead (spend / leads)
- Cost per estimate (spend / estimates)
- Cost per job (spend / jobs)
- Return on investment ((revenue - spend) / spend)

A channel with 5x ROI (you spend $1,000, you get $5,000 in revenue) is printing money. A channel with 1.5x ROI barely covers your overhead. A channel below 1x ROI is losing money.

Most contractors can't produce these numbers. Which means they can't make informed decisions about where to spend more or less.

**Dashboard Setup**

You don't need a fancy BI tool. You need a spreadsheet that answers three questions:

1. Where did our leads come from this month?
2. What did each lead cost us?
3. Which channels are generating profitable jobs?

Update it weekly. Review it monthly. Adjust spend quarterly.

We build these dashboards in Google Sheets connected to call tracking and CRM data via Zapier. Takes about 4 hours to set up, saves thousands in wasted spend.

## The 12-Month Marketing Plan

If you're starting from scratch or rebuilding a failed marketing effort, here's how to phase it.

**Months 1-3: Foundation**

Fix your tracking. This is not optional. You cannot optimize what you cannot measure. GA4 properly configured. Call tracking installed. CRM integrated.

Optimize your Google Business Profile completely. Every field, weekly posts, photo uploads.

Launch LSAs if you haven't. Get through Google's verification process and start generating high-intent leads.

Build or fix your core website pages. Homepage, service pages, contact page. Mobile-optimized, fast-loading, clear CTAs.

Set up basic automation. Lead response texts at minimum.

**Months 4-6: Expansion**

Layer in Google Search Ads. Start conservative with exact match keywords. Monitor search terms report weekly to add negatives.

Begin review generation system. Text follow-ups after every job.

Create remaining service and location pages. Expand your SEO footprint.

Test Facebook retargeting. Small budget, focused on people who visited your site but didn't convert.

**Months 7-12: Optimization**

Now you have data. Use it.

Double down on channels with highest ROI. Cut or reduce channels underperforming.

[A/B test landing pages](/services/cro). Try different headlines, different CTAs, different layouts.

Expand geographic targeting if demand supports it.

Add seasonal campaigns for predictable spikes (spring for roofing, fall for HVAC).

Build out [content for longer-tail keywords](/services/content). "How to know if you need a new roof" type guides that capture early-stage research.

## What Happens Next

This guide is around 4,000 words. The implementation is hundreds of hours. Most contractors won't do it. They'll hire an agency that shows them pretty reports full of impressions, or they'll try one thing for two months, not see results, and quit.

The contractors who dominate their local markets do this work. They track everything. They follow up fast. They optimize ruthlessly. It's not complicated, but it is hard.

If you want help implementing this—actually building the tracking, setting up the automation, running the ads—that's what we do. We've built these systems for dozens of home service companies. We'll build you a dashboard where you can see exactly which marketing generates which jobs. No vanity metrics. No mystery.

    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'That $3,000/month report full of "impressions" and "reach"? It might be hiding the fact that you\'re getting nothing in return.',
    content: `
Last month, a contractor I know showed me his marketing report. He'd been paying $3,000 a month for "digital marketing services" for eight months. That's $24,000.

I asked him a simple question: "How many leads did this generate?"

He didn't know. The reports talked about impressions, reach, engagement rates. Lots of colorful graphs. Not a single mention of phone calls, form submissions, or actual customers. When he asked his agency directly, they sent him a longer PDF. Still no answer.

This isn't an isolated case. It's the damn industry standard.

## Red Flag #1: Vanity Metrics

Here's what a typical agency report looks like:

- 50,000 impressions
- 12,000 reach
- 3.2% engagement rate
- "Strong brand visibility"

Here's what that same report should say:

- 50,000 impressions
- 0 phone calls
- 0 form submissions
- **$0 in value**

"Impressions" means your ad loaded on someone's screen. They probably didn't see it. They definitely didn't care. Engagement rate? Someone scrolled past your post slightly slower than the others.

None of this matters if it doesn't turn into business. A report without lead counts, cost per lead, and conversion rates is a report designed to hide failure. If your agency can't tell you how many customers they brought in last month, they're either incompetent or hoping you won't ask.

## Red Flag #2: The "Brand Building" Excuse

When you press an agency for real numbers, they'll often retreat to "brand awareness."

"We're building your brand. You can't measure that directly. It takes time to see results."

This is cover for having nothing to show. Real brand building has milestones. After 3 months, direct search traffic should increase. After 6 months, you should see branded keyword growth. These are measurable.

If your agency talks about brand awareness without specific timelines and metrics, they're hoping you'll keep paying while they figure out what they're doing. Real agencies set expectations: "By month three, we expect X. If we don't hit it, here's what we'll change."

## Red Flag #3: Data Hostages

Ask your agency for login access to your Google Analytics. Your Google Ads account. Your Facebook Business Manager.

If they hesitate, that's a problem. If they say "we manage that for you," that's a bigger problem.

**You should own everything.** Your analytics, your ad accounts, your domain, your hosting. All of it. An agency that sets up accounts in their name is holding your data hostage. When you leave, you lose your history, your audiences, your everything.

We set up every account in our clients' names on day one. Full admin access. If you fire us tomorrow, you walk away with everything we built. That's how it should work.

## Red Flag #4: The Escape Tax

Watch out for:

- "Setup fees" that mysteriously equal one month's payment
- "Ramp-up periods" where results don't count
- 6-12 month contracts with early termination penalties
- Vague language about "campaign momentum" if you consider leaving

These are designed to trap you. If an agency is confident in their work, they don't need to lock you in. Good results keep clients around. Contracts keep hostages around.

We work month-to-month. No setup fees. No termination penalties. Every month, we have to earn your business again. That's how it should be.

## What to Demand Instead

Before signing with any agency—including us—ask these five questions:

**1. "Can I see my Google Analytics in real time?"**
You should have your own login. If they won't give it to you, walk away.

**2. "How many leads or calls did we get last month?"**
An actual number. Not impressions. Not reach. Leads.

**3. "What's my cost per lead?"**
Total spend divided by total leads. If they can't answer this, they're not tracking properly.

**4. "Do I own all my accounts and data?"**
Google Ads, Facebook, Analytics, Search Console—all should be in your name.

**5. "What happens if I cancel next month?"**
The answer should be: "You keep everything, we part ways." Anything else is a red flag.

## Why We Built BKND This Way

I'm a developer by trade. Spent years building software where everything is measured, tested, and accountable. Every feature either works or it doesn't. You can't hide behind "brand awareness" when the code doesn't compile.

I got tired of watching businesses waste money on marketing that couldn't prove its value. So I built an agency that treats clients like adults. We show you the real numbers. We give you full ownership. We earn your business every single month.

If that sounds refreshing, we should talk. If you like the mystery, there are plenty of other agencies happy to take your $3,000.

    title: 'The Real Cost of Vanity Metrics',
    date: '2026-01-15',
    excerpt: 'Impressions and engagement rates feel good to report, but they can hide the truth about whether your marketing is actually working.',
    content: `
Your marketing report lands in your inbox. Impressions are up 200%. Engagement rate hit an all-time high. Social followers grew by 15%.

Everything looks great. Except revenue is flat.

## What Are Vanity Metrics?

Vanity metrics are numbers that look impressive but don't correlate with business outcomes. They're easy to grow, easy to report, and completely useless for making decisions.

Common vanity metrics include:

- **Impressions**: How many times your ad was displayed (not how many people actually noticed it)
- **Follower counts**: How many people clicked follow (not how many care about what you post)
- **Page views**: How many times a page loaded (not how many people read the content)

## The Opportunity Cost

Every hour spent optimizing for vanity metrics is an hour not spent on what matters. While your team celebrates a viral post that generated zero leads, your competitor is running A/B tests on landing pages that convert.

## What to Measure Instead

Focus on metrics that connect to revenue:

**Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**: How much does it cost to acquire a customer?

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: How much revenue does a customer generate over time?

**Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: For every dollar spent on advertising, how much revenue comes back?

**Pipeline Velocity**: How quickly are leads moving through your funnel?

These metrics might not look as impressive in a slide deck, but they'll tell you whether your marketing is actually working.

## Making the Shift

The transition from vanity metrics to meaningful metrics isn't easy. It requires better tracking, clearer attribution, and often uncomfortable conversations about what's really driving growth.

But once you make the shift, you'll wonder how you ever operated any other way.

    date: '2026-01-10',
    excerpt: 'Understanding which marketing channels actually drive revenue requires more than just looking at last-click data.',
    content: `
A customer finds you through a Google ad, reads three blog posts over two weeks, clicks a retargeting ad on LinkedIn, and finally converts after receiving an email.

Which channel gets credit for the sale?

## The Last-Click Fallacy

Most businesses default to last-click attribution. Whatever touchpoint happened right before conversion gets 100% of the credit. It's simple, but it's wrong.

In our example, the email would get all the credit. But would that customer have converted without the initial Google ad that introduced them to your brand? Without the blog content that built trust? Without the retargeting that kept you top of mind?

## Why Attribution Matters

If you're making budget decisions based on bad attribution data, you're probably:

- Over-investing in bottom-of-funnel channels
- Under-investing in awareness and consideration
- Missing the full picture of your customer journey

## Better Approaches

**Multi-Touch Attribution**: Distribute credit across all touchpoints based on their role in the journey. First touch introduced the prospect. Middle touches nurtured them. Last touch closed the deal.

**Incrementality Testing**: Run controlled experiments to measure the true impact of each channel. What happens to revenue when you turn off a specific ad campaign?

**Marketing Mix Modeling**: Use statistical analysis to understand how different channels contribute to overall performance, accounting for factors like seasonality and market conditions.

## The Honest Truth

Perfect attribution is impossible. Customer journeys are messy. Some touchpoints happen offline. Some influence can't be tracked.

But imperfect attribution based on solid methodology is infinitely better than last-click guessing. The goal isn't perfect data—it's better decisions.
