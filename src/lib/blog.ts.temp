    excerpt: 'You cannot scale a service business by manually following up with every lead. Here is the automation stack that actually works for contractors and home service companies, from someone who builds these systems.',
    content: `
You cannot scale a service business by manually following up with every lead. At some point, the math breaks.

A plumbing company gets 50 new leads per week. Each lead needs a follow-up call within 5 minutes to maximize conversion. Then a text. Then an email sequence. Then appointment reminders. Then a review request after the job.

That is 250+ touchpoints per week just for new leads. Add in quote follow-ups, past customer reactivation, and seasonal campaigns, and you are looking at a full-time job that nobody is doing.

:::stat 21x
Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert than those contacted after 30 minutes. Yet most service businesses respond in hours. Some never respond at all.
:::
This is why leads slip through cracks. Why reviews do not get requested. Why customers who called once never hear from you again.

Automation fixes this. Not by replacing human interaction, but by handling the repetitive sequences so your team can focus on conversations that matter.

## Why Most Service Businesses Fail at Automation

I have seen two failure modes repeatedly.

The first: buying expensive software and using 10% of it. A company pays $500/month for a platform with 200 features. They set up basic email sequences. Everything else sits untouched because nobody knows how to configure it.

The second: cobbling together free tools that do not talk to each other. Gmail plus Google Calendar plus some random SMS app. Nothing syncs. Data lives in five places. Leads fall through gaps between systems.

The fix is not more software. It is a coherent system designed around your actual workflow, built to handle the specific sequences that generate revenue for service businesses.

## The $200/Month Automation Stack

You do not need enterprise software. You need the right tools connected properly.

Here is the stack I recommend for most service businesses doing $500K-$5M in revenue.

### Option 1: Go High Level ($97-297/month)

This is the all-in-one option. CRM, email, SMS, call tracking, landing pages, review requests, and automation workflows in one platform.

The advantage: everything talks to everything else natively. No integration headaches. Build a workflow that triggers when a lead comes in, sends a text, waits 2 minutes, sends an email, waits 1 day, assigns a follow-up task. All in one place.

The disadvantage: the interface is not pretty. There is a learning curve. Some features feel half-baked compared to dedicated tools.

Best for: companies that want one platform to rule everything and are willing to invest time learning it.

### Option 2: Industry-Specific CRM + Integrations

**For general contractors and home services:** Jobber ($49-199/month) or Housecall Pro ($49-149/month)

These platforms are built for field service businesses. Scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, and customer management designed for how you actually work.

Automation is more limited than Go High Level, but the core workflows exist: appointment reminders, follow-up emails, review requests.

**For HVAC specifically:** ServiceTitan (enterprise pricing) if you are doing $2M+. Overkill for smaller operations.

**For roofers and exterior contractors:** JobNimbus ($25-150/month) or AccuLynx (varies) both handle the estimate-to-close workflow well.

### Adding What Industry CRMs Lack

Industry-specific CRMs handle scheduling and jobs well. They usually lack sophisticated marketing automation. Fill the gaps with:

**Email marketing:** Mailchimp ($13/month for 500 contacts) or ConvertKit ($15/month). These handle drip sequences, segmentation, and email deliverability better than most CRMs.

**SMS marketing:** SimpleTexting ($29/month) or Textline ($59/month). Two-way texting, automation triggers, and compliance handling.

**Integration glue:** Zapier ($19.99/month) or Make ($9/month) connects everything. When a job is marked complete in Jobber, trigger a review request in SimpleTexting. When a form is submitted on your website, create a contact in your CRM and start an email sequence.

Total cost with this approach: $150-250/month depending on contact volume and which tools you choose.

:::key
Your total automation stack should cost $97-297/month, not $500+. If you are paying more, you are either at enterprise scale or you bought features you do not need.
:::

## The Five Essential Automations

I have built dozens of automation systems for service businesses. These five sequences generate the most ROI.

### 1. Speed-to-Lead Follow-Up

This is the most important automation you will build. Research shows that responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you 21 times more likely to qualify them compared to waiting 30 minutes.

Most service businesses respond in hours. Some respond in days. Many never respond at all.

Here is the sequence that works:

**Minute 0:** Lead comes in (form submission, phone call, or ad).

**Minute 1:** Automated text message. "Hi [Name], this is [Company]. We got your request for [service]. What is the best time to discuss?"

**Minute 2:** Automated email with more detail. Include your phone number, brief company intro, and what to expect next.

**Minute 3:** Internal notification to your team. Slack message, email alert, or CRM task assignment. Someone needs to call this lead now.

**Minute 15:** If no response to the text, send a follow-up. "Just wanted to make sure you got my message. We typically respond within a few hours."

**Hour 1:** If still no response, another touchpoint. This one can be a voicemail drop if your system supports it.

**Day 1, 3, 7:** Continued email sequence with value-add content relevant to their inquiry. Not "just checking in" messages. Actual information about the service they requested.

This sequence runs automatically for every single lead. No manual intervention required until someone responds.

:::pullquote
"The contractor who responds in 5 minutes wins. The contractor who responds in 5 hours wonders why nobody answers their calls." - Every sales manager, ever
:::

### 2. Review Request Automation

You need reviews. You will not remember to ask for them consistently. Automate it.

**Trigger:** Job marked complete in your CRM.

**Timing:** Wait 2-4 hours. Long enough for them to experience the work, short enough that satisfaction is still fresh.

**Channel:** Text message first. Email as backup.

**Message:** "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing [Company] for your [service]. If you were happy with our work, would you take 30 seconds to leave us a Google review? [direct link]"

That direct link matters. Do not send them to Google and make them search for you. Generate a direct review link from your Google Business Profile.

For more detail on making [analytics and tracking work together](/services/analytics), including review attribution, that guide covers the technical setup.

**Follow-up:** If no review after 3 days, send one more message. After that, stop. Do not badger people.

:::stat 15-20%
The benchmark for review request conversion. If you are getting reviews on 15-20% of completed jobs with automation, your system is working. Below 10%? Your timing or messaging needs work.
:::
Some businesses segment this: only send review requests to customers who rated their experience 4+ stars in a post-job survey. This protects against negative reviews while still generating volume.

### 3. Appointment Reminders

No-shows cost money. Every missed appointment is lost revenue plus wasted drive time.

**24 hours before:** Text and email reminder with appointment details. Include what to expect, how to prepare, and a clear way to reschedule.

**2 hours before:** Quick text reminder. "We will see you at 2pm today. Reply C to confirm or R to reschedule."

**On the way:** "Our technician is on the way and will arrive in approximately 30 minutes."


:::stat 30-50%
Reduction in no-shows from a proper reminder sequence. For a company averaging 3 no-shows per week at $300 each, that is $23,000-$39,000 in recovered revenue annually.
:::
This sequence reduces no-shows by 30-50% in my experience. It also reduces "I forgot" phone calls that waste your office staff's time.

### 4. Quote Follow-Up Sequence

You give an estimate. The customer says they need to think about it. Then silence.

Most contractors follow up once, maybe twice, then give up. The customer goes with whoever was most persistent.

Here is a better approach:

**Day 1 after estimate:** Thank you email with estimate summary and answers to common questions.

**Day 3:** Text message checking in. "Hi [Name], wanted to see if you had any questions about the estimate we sent. Happy to clarify anything."

**Day 7:** Email with additional value. Could be a case study, financing options, or warranty information relevant to their project.

**Day 14:** Phone call (human, not automated) if the lead is qualified and the job is worth it.

**Day 30:** Final email. "Your estimate for [project] is still valid. If you decide to move forward, we would love to help."

### 5. Past Customer Reactivation

Your best leads are people who already hired you once. They know you. They trust you. They just need a reminder.

**For HVAC and seasonal services:** Automated maintenance reminders.

"Hi [Name], it has been 6 months since we serviced your AC. Most systems need annual maintenance to stay efficient. Want to schedule your tune-up? [booking link]"

**For one-time services (roofing, remodeling):** Periodic check-ins with referral asks.

"Hi [Name], we installed your roof 2 years ago. How is it holding up? If you know anyone who needs roofing work, we would appreciate the referral. We offer $X for successful referrals."

**For all services:** Annual holiday or seasonal touchpoint. Not a sales pitch. Just staying top of mind.

"Happy holidays from [Company]. Thanks for being a customer. If you need anything in the new year, we are here."

This is not aggressive. It is maintenance. One or two touchpoints per year keeps you in their memory when they need you again or when a friend asks for a recommendation.

## Lead Follow-Up Automation: The Deep Dive

Let me break down the speed-to-lead sequence in more detail because this is where most service businesses lose the most money.

### The Channels

**SMS is king for immediate response.** 98% of text messages are read within 3 minutes. Email sits unread for hours. Phone calls go to voicemail. Text gets through.

**Email handles detail and documentation.** Attach estimates, share links, provide information that does not fit in a text.

**Phone remains critical for closing.** Automation gets them engaged. A human closes the deal.

### The Workflow Architecture

Here is how I structure the workflow in Go High Level (similar logic applies in other platforms):

**Trigger:** New contact created from any source (web form, Facebook lead ad, manual entry, phone call transcription).

**Step 1:** Wait 1 minute. (Gives time for any data syncing.)

**Step 2:** Send SMS template. Dynamic fields pull their name and inquiry type.

**Step 3:** Wait 2 minutes.

**Step 4:** Send email template.

**Step 5:** Create task for sales team with high priority.

**Step 6:** Wait 1 hour.

**Step 7:** Condition check: Did they reply? (Check for inbound SMS or email.)

**If yes:** Stop automation, notify team for human follow-up.

**If no:** Send follow-up SMS.

**Step 8:** Wait 1 day.

**Step 9:** Another condition check. Reply or callback?

**If yes:** Stop and notify.

**If no:** Send Day 1 email (value content, not another "just following up").

This continues through Day 7, gradually decreasing intensity and switching from "did you get my message" to "here is helpful information."

### Message Templates That Convert

Bad follow-up text: "Hi, this is ABC Plumbing following up on your inquiry. Please call us back at your earliest convenience."

That reads like a robot wrote it. Because a robot did.

Good follow-up text: "Hey [Name], it's Mike from ABC Plumbing. Saw you need help with [specific issue]. What's the best time to call you today?"

Personal. Specific. Asks a concrete question.

:::tip
Use a real person's name in automated messages, not just the company name. "It's Mike from ABC Plumbing" converts 23% better than "This is ABC Plumbing" in our testing.
:::
Personal. Specific. Asks a concrete question.

For email, the same principle applies. Do not write corporate-speak. Write like a human who wants to help solve their problem.

## Review Generation That Scales

Let me expand on the review automation because [HVAC marketing](/blog/hvac-marketing) and other service industries live and die by their review count.

### The Technical Setup

**Step 1:** Create a Google review direct link. Go to your Google Business Profile, click "Ask for reviews," and copy that link. Or construct it manually: https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=[YOUR_PLACE_ID]

**Step 2:** Set up the trigger in your CRM. "Job status changed to Complete" or "Invoice marked Paid" both work.

**Step 3:** Add a delay. I use 2-4 hours for most services. For emergency services where relief is immediate, 1 hour can work.

**Step 4:** Send the text. Keep it short. Include the link. Make it easy.

**Step 5:** Send backup email 24 hours later if no review detected. (Some platforms can detect when a review is posted and stop the sequence.)

### Handling Negative Experiences

The last thing you want is to automate asking an unhappy customer for a review.

Two approaches:

**Post-job survey first:** Before asking for a review, send a one-question survey. "How would you rate your experience? 1-5 stars." Only trigger the review request for 4-5 star responses. Route 1-3 star responses to a manager for personal outreach.

**Technician feedback:** Let your technician flag difficult jobs or unhappy customers. If flagged, skip the automated review request.


:::warning
Never automate review requests without a negative experience filter. One 1-star review from an automated request to an unhappy customer can tank your rating for months.
:::

Either approach is better than blindly asking everyone.

## Seasonal Campaign Automation

[Home services marketing](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) is inherently seasonal. HVAC has summer and winter peaks. Roofing follows storm seasons. Landscaping follows growing seasons.

Manual campaign management means scrambling every season transition. Automation means campaigns run themselves.

### Spring HVAC Example

**January 15:** Segment your list for "Residential AC customers."

**February 1:** First email. "Spring is coming. When did you last service your AC? Schedule your tune-up before the rush." Include early-bird pricing if you offer it.

**February 15:** SMS to non-openers. Same message, different channel.

**March 1:** Second email with urgency. "Our March schedule is 40% booked. Lock in your tune-up time now."

**March 15:** Final push to remaining non-booked customers.

This runs every year automatically. Adjust the content once, and the sequence handles itself.

### Storm Season for Roofers

**Trigger:** Weather alert in your service area. (Some automation platforms integrate with weather APIs.)

**Immediate response:** Email and SMS to your customer list. "Severe weather expected in [area]. If you experience any damage, we're here to help. Save our number: [phone]."

**Post-storm (48 hours later):** "The storm has passed. We're offering free inspections this week for any homeowners concerned about damage. [Booking link]."

This positions you as responsive and helpful while generating legitimate leads.

## Integration: Making Systems Talk

Stand-alone tools are useless if they do not share data. This is where [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics) separates professionals from amateurs.

### The Integration Stack

**Zapier or Make:** These no-code platforms connect almost anything. They work on a trigger-action model.

Example: When a new contact is created in Jobber (trigger), add them to a Mailchimp audience (action), send a welcome email (action), and add a row to a Google Sheet for reporting (action).

**Native integrations:** Many platforms now connect directly. Go High Level integrates with Facebook Lead Ads natively. Housecall Pro connects to QuickBooks. Check what your tools already support before adding middleware.

**Webhooks for custom connections:** If you have a developer (or access to one), webhooks handle anything Zapier cannot. Your website form can POST data directly to your CRM. Your CRM can notify your analytics platform when a job closes.

### Common Integration Patterns

**Lead capture to CRM:** Website form submits to your CRM, creating a contact and triggering the speed-to-lead sequence.

**CRM to email platform:** New contacts sync to your email marketing tool for newsletter and campaign sends.

**Job completion to review request:** Closed job triggers the review automation sequence.

**Call tracking to CRM:** Inbound calls create or update contact records with call recordings attached.

**CRM to analytics:** Closed revenue data passes back to Google Analytics and ad platforms for accurate ROI tracking.

This last one is critical. Without it, you optimize for leads. With it, you optimize for actual revenue.

## Measuring Automation ROI

Do not set up automation and forget it. Measure what matters.

### Metrics to Track

**Speed to lead:** Average time from lead submission to first touchpoint. Target: under 5 minutes.

**Response rate:** Percentage of leads who reply to automated sequences. Benchmark: 15-25% for SMS, 5-10% for email.

**Review request conversion:** Percentage of completed jobs that result in reviews. Benchmark: 10-20%.

**Reactivation revenue:** Revenue generated from past customer campaigns. Track this separately from new customer revenue.

**Automation-influenced deals:** Deals where automated touchpoints occurred before human conversion. This shows automation's contribution to pipeline.

### The Reporting Setup

Create a monthly automation report with:

- Total leads processed through automation
- Average response time
- Lead-to-appointment rate
- Reviews generated
- Reactivation campaign revenue
- Any automation failures or errors

This report takes 30 minutes to build once and 10 minutes to review monthly. It is how you know your system is working.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

After building automation for dozens of service businesses, I see the same mistakes repeatedly.

### Mistake 1: Over-Automation

Sending 15 emails in 7 days does not make you persistent. It makes you spam.

The fix: Map your sequence to actual customer decision timelines. Emergency services need fast, intense follow-up. Major purchases need patient, value-based nurturing.

### Mistake 2: Generic Messages

"Just following up" and "wanted to touch base" signal that you have nothing to say.

The fix: Every automated message should provide value or ask a specific question. If you cannot justify why a message exists, delete it.

### Mistake 3: No Human Handoff

Automation warms leads. Humans close deals. If your sequence has no point where a human takes over, you will lose conversions.

The fix: Build clear triggers for human intervention. Hot lead indicators (replied, clicked multiple emails, high-value service) should notify your team immediately.

### Mistake 4: Set and Forget

Automation is not a crockpot. You cannot set it and walk away forever.

The fix: Monthly review of metrics and message performance. Quarterly updates to copy and sequences. Annual overhaul to align with business changes.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Compliance

:::warning
SMS marketing has legal requirements. TCPA violations can cost $500-1,500 per message. One unhappy customer reporting you could mean a $15,000 fine. Get explicit opt-in. Include opt-out instructions. Honor unsubscribes immediately.
:::

The fix: Get explicit opt-in before texting. Include opt-out instructions. Honor unsubscribes immediately. When in doubt, consult a lawyer.

## Getting Started

You do not need to build everything at once. Start with the highest-impact automation and expand from there.

**Week 1:** Set up speed-to-lead sequence. This is where the most money leaks.

**Week 2:** Implement review request automation. Takes an hour, runs forever.

**Week 3:** Build appointment reminder sequence. Reduces no-shows immediately.

**Week 4:** Create quote follow-up workflow. Recovers lost estimates.

**Month 2:** Add past customer reactivation and seasonal campaigns.


:::pullquote
"Automation is not about removing humans from the process. It is about removing busywork so humans can do what they do best: build relationships and close deals."
:::

Each automation you add compounds on the others. Within 90 days, you have a system that handles hundreds of touchpoints automatically.

    title: 'Call Tracking Setup Guide for Contractors: From Zero to Full Attribution',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Phone calls drive revenue for contractors. This technical guide walks through setting up call tracking from scratch—DNI, tracking pools, platform selection, GA4 integration, and keyword-level attribution.',
    content: `
For contractors, phone calls are revenue. A homeowner searching "emergency plumber near me" at 2 AM isn't filling out a form. They're calling.

The problem? Most contractors have no idea which marketing channels actually generate those calls. They're spending $5,000/month on Google Ads and another $2,000 on SEO, but when the phone rings, they can't tell if it came from a paid ad, organic search, their Google Business Profile, or the truck wrap their crew drives around.

This guide fixes that. We're going to set up call tracking from scratch—the technical implementation that lets you know exactly which marketing dollars produce phone calls and which are wasted.

## Why Call Tracking Is Non-Negotiable

Let me show you what flying blind looks like.

A roofing company spends $4,000/month on Google Ads. They get 80 calls per month. Good news, right? But here's what they don't know:

- 30 of those calls came from organic search (free traffic)
- 15 came from their Google Business Profile (also free)
- 20 came from Google Ads (the paid traffic they're tracking)
- 10 came from a Facebook campaign they forgot was running
- 5 came from the yard signs they put up at job sites

Without call tracking, they attribute all 80 calls to Google Ads and think their $50 cost-per-call is acceptable. The real cost-per-call from Google Ads? $200. They're losing money on paid search while their free channels do the heavy lifting.

This isn't hypothetical. I see this constantly when auditing contractor marketing. The channels they think are working often aren't. The channels they ignore often are.

[Call tracking isn't just about measuring—it's about making smart decisions](/services/analytics) with your marketing budget. Every dollar you spend should be traceable to a result.

## How Call Tracking Actually Works

Before we set anything up, you need to understand the mechanics.

### Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI)

This is the core technology. Here's how it works:

1. A visitor lands on your website from Google Ads
2. JavaScript on your site detects the traffic source (via UTM parameters, referrer, or cookies)
3. The script dynamically swaps your main phone number with a tracking number
4. When the visitor calls, the tracking platform knows it came from Google Ads
5. The tracking platform forwards the call to your actual business number

The visitor never knows they're calling a tracking number. The call still rings to your office. But now you have data.

The key insight: DNI only works on your website. If someone sees your number on a Google Business Profile or a yard sign, they're calling a static number. We'll need different tracking numbers for those sources.

### Tracking Number Pools

For keyword-level tracking (knowing exactly which search term triggered the call), you need number pools.

Here's the problem DNI solves partially: you can track that a call came from Google Ads, but if you're running 50 different keywords, which keyword drove that specific call?

Number pools solve this. Instead of one tracking number, you have a pool of 10-20 numbers. When a visitor lands on your site, they get assigned a specific number from the pool. That assignment is tracked along with all their session data—including the keyword they searched.

The visitor stays assigned to that number for a set period (usually 30 minutes to 4 hours). If they call within that window, you know exactly which keyword brought them.

Pool size matters. If you get 100 website visitors per hour and your pool has 10 numbers, each number is assigned to 10 different visitors. Some precision is lost. For most contractors, a pool of 15-20 numbers provides sufficient accuracy without excessive cost.

### Source Attribution

Call tracking platforms categorize calls by source. Standard categories include:

**Direct Traffic**: Typed your URL directly or used a bookmark
**Organic Search**: Found you through Google/Bing natural results
**Paid Search**: Clicked a Google Ads or Microsoft Ads ad
**Referral**: Clicked a link from another website
**Social**: Came from Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
**Email**: Clicked a link in an email campaign
**Offline**: Called a static tracking number (yard sign, truck wrap, etc.)

Each source gets its own tracking number or is identified through DNI. This is your attribution foundation.

## Choosing a Call Tracking Platform

Three platforms dominate the contractor space. Here's an honest breakdown.

### CallRail

**Best for**: Most contractors. Clean interface, strong integrations, reasonable pricing.

**Pricing**: Starts at $45/month for 10 local numbers and 500 minutes. Most contractors need the $95/month plan for number pools and keyword-level tracking.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent Google Ads and GA4 integrations
- Call recording and transcription included
- Form tracking included (track form submissions alongside calls)
- Lead Center app for managing calls on mobile

**Weaknesses**:
- Transcription accuracy is decent but not perfect
- Advanced features require higher tiers

**Setup complexity**: Low. Most contractors can set this up themselves.

### CallTrackingMetrics

**Best for**: Agencies managing multiple client accounts. Power users who need granular control.

**Pricing**: Starts at $39/month for basic tracking. Full-featured plans run $99-199/month.

**Strengths**:
- More granular routing options
- Better multi-location support
- Advanced IVR (phone tree) capabilities
- Deeper customization options

**Weaknesses**:
- Interface is less intuitive than CallRail
- Learning curve is steeper
- Some features feel dated

**Setup complexity**: Medium. Technical users will be fine. Others might struggle.

### WhatConverts

**Best for**: Agencies that need lead management alongside tracking. Companies that want all conversions (calls, forms, chats) in one platform.

**Pricing**: Starts at $30/month for basic tracking. Most contractors need the $60-100/month tiers.

**Strengths**:
- Unified lead management (calls, forms, chats, transactions)
- Strong quotable lead tracking
- Good agency features
- Cleaner reporting than CallTrackingMetrics

**Weaknesses**:
- Call-specific features aren't as deep as CallRail
- Fewer direct integrations

**Setup complexity**: Low to medium.

### My Recommendation

For a single-location contractor setting this up themselves: **CallRail**. It's the right balance of power and simplicity.

For agencies or multi-location businesses: **CallTrackingMetrics** or **WhatConverts** depending on whether you prioritize call routing or unified lead management.

## Basic Setup: Getting Your First Tracking Numbers

I'll walk through CallRail, but the concepts apply to any platform.

### Step 1: Create Your Account and Company

Sign up at callrail.com. Create a "company" for your business. One company = one business with shared settings and numbers.

### Step 2: Purchase Your First Tracking Numbers

You need separate numbers for each major source you want to track independently:

**Website tracking number**: This will be swapped in via DNI
**Google Business Profile number**: Static number for your GBP listing
**Offline tracking numbers**: One for each offline source (truck wraps, yard signs, direct mail)

In CallRail, go to Numbers > New Tracking Number.

For local presence, choose local numbers with your area code. Some platforms offer toll-free numbers, but local numbers convert better for local service businesses.

**Cost**: Each local number typically costs $3-5/month. Minutes are billed separately, usually 3-5 cents per minute.

### Step 3: Install the JavaScript Snippet

For DNI to work, you need the tracking script on your website.

In CallRail, go to Tracking > Swap Targets. You'll get a JavaScript snippet that looks something like this:

\`\`\`javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(a,e,c,f,g,h,b,d){var k={ak:"XXXXXXXXXX",cl:"XXXXXXXXXX",autoreplace:"+1XXXXXXXXXX"};
  a[c]=a[c]||function(){(a[c].q=a[c].q||[]).push(arguments)};
  // ... rest of snippet
</script>
\`\`\`

Add this snippet to your website's \`<head>\` section, ideally through Google Tag Manager or your CMS's script injection feature.

**Important**: The \`autoreplace\` value should be your main business phone number—the one currently displayed on your site. The script will swap this number with the tracking number.

### Step 4: Configure Swap Targets

The swap target tells CallRail which number to replace. In most cases, this is your main business number.

If you display your phone number in multiple formats on your site (e.g., "512-555-1234" and "(512) 555-1234"), you'll need to add both formats as swap targets.

### Step 5: Test the Installation

Open an incognito window and visit your site from a trackable source. For example:

1. Go to Google and search for your business
2. Click through to your website from the organic results
3. Check if your phone number changed to the tracking number

You can also use CallRail's "Test Website" feature in the tracking settings.

## Source-Level Tracking: Covering All Your Channels

Website tracking only captures visitors who reach your site. But calls come from many places.

### Google Business Profile Tracking

Your GBP listing shows a phone number. When someone calls that number directly from Google Maps or the knowledge panel, they never touch your website. DNI doesn't help here.

**Solution**: Create a dedicated tracking number for your GBP listing.

1. In CallRail, create a new tracking number
2. Set the source as "Google Business Profile" or create a custom source
3. In your GBP dashboard, replace your main number with this tracking number

**Important consideration**: Changing your GBP phone number temporarily affects your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency, which matters for local SEO. However, the tracking benefit typically outweighs this concern if you update your number consistently across other directories.

### Google Ads Call Extensions and Call-Only Ads

Google Ads offers its own call tracking through forwarding numbers. But here's the problem: Google's tracking only tells you a call happened. It doesn't integrate with your call recording, transcription, or CRM.

**Better approach**: Use your call tracking platform's number in your Google Ads call extensions.

1. Create a tracking number in CallRail with source "Google Ads"
2. In Google Ads, go to Ads & Extensions > Extensions > Call Extension
3. Use your CallRail tracking number instead of your main number
4. Enable call reporting in Google Ads to track call length

This gives you Google Ads data AND full call tracking capabilities.

### Offline Tracking: Truck Wraps, Yard Signs, Direct Mail

Every offline marketing asset should have its own tracking number.

**Truck wrap number**: Calls from people who saw your truck in traffic or parked at a job site.

**Yard sign number**: Calls from neighbors who see your sign at a current job.

**Direct mail number**: Calls from recipients of your mailers.

Create separate tracking numbers for each. The numbers should be memorable—and ideally local to build trust.

Print these numbers large and prominently. A tracking number buried in fine print defeats the purpose.

## Keyword-Level Tracking: The Advanced Setup

Source-level tracking tells you Google Ads generated 30 calls this month. Keyword-level tracking tells you "emergency ac repair austin" generated 15 of them while "hvac company near me" generated 3.

This requires number pools and proper parameter passing.

### Setting Up a Number Pool

In CallRail, go to Numbers > Number Pool. Choose:

- **Pool size**: Start with 15-20 numbers
- **Source**: Website (or specific like Google Ads if you want granular control)
- **Reuse interval**: How long before a number can be reassigned. 30 minutes is typical.

More numbers = more precision = more cost. Find the balance that works for your traffic level.

### Passing gclid for Google Ads Attribution

The gclid (Google Click ID) is Google's unique identifier for each ad click. Capturing this connects call tracking data directly to Google Ads campaigns, ad groups, and keywords.

CallRail automatically captures gclid if you have:

1. Auto-tagging enabled in Google Ads (on by default)
2. The CallRail JavaScript properly installed

To verify: In Google Ads, go to Settings > Account Settings > Auto-tagging. Ensure it's enabled.

Once connected, your CallRail reports will show exactly which keywords, ads, and campaigns generated each call.

### Microsoft Ads Integration

Same concept, different parameter. Microsoft Ads uses the msclkid. CallRail captures this automatically as well. Enable auto-tagging in Microsoft Ads under Tools > UET tags.

## Integration Setup: Connecting Your Stack

Call tracking data in isolation is useful. Call tracking data connected to your analytics and CRM is powerful.

### GA4 Integration

This is critical. Google Analytics 4 should show calls as conversions alongside form submissions and other events.

In CallRail:

1. Go to Settings > Integrations > Google Analytics 4
2. Connect your GA4 property
3. Configure which events to send (phone call starts, calls over X duration, etc.)

CallRail will send events to GA4 like:
- \`phone_call_start\`: Any inbound call
- \`phone_call_30s\`: Calls lasting 30+ seconds (often used as qualified calls)
- \`phone_call_complete\`: Any completed call

**Set up conversions in GA4**:

1. In GA4, go to Configure > Events
2. Find the call events from CallRail
3. Mark them as conversions

Now your GA4 reports show true conversion data—forms AND calls from all sources.

### Google Ads Conversion Import

For proper Google Ads optimization, you need to import call conversions back into Google Ads.

**Option 1: Direct integration**

CallRail can send conversions directly to Google Ads via the API. In Settings > Integrations > Google Ads, connect your account and configure which calls count as conversions.

**Option 2: Import from GA4**

If you're already sending call events to GA4, you can import them into Google Ads from there. In Google Ads, go to Tools > Conversions > New conversion action > Import > Google Analytics 4.

This approach keeps GA4 as your source of truth for all conversions.

**Why this matters**: Google's smart bidding algorithms (Target CPA, Maximize Conversions) optimize toward your conversion actions. If calls aren't included, Google optimizes for form fills only—which might represent a fraction of your actual leads.

### CRM Integration

Your call data should live in your CRM alongside your other leads.

Most call tracking platforms integrate with:
- HubSpot
- Salesforce
- Zoho CRM
- Housecall Pro
- ServiceTitan
- Jobber

The integration typically creates a contact record for each caller with:
- Phone number
- Call timestamp
- Call duration
- Call recording link
- Traffic source
- Keyword (if applicable)

This lets you track leads from first call through closed job, attributing revenue back to specific marketing sources.

## Call Recording and Transcription

Call tracking platforms offer recording and transcription. Use them.

### Legal Considerations

Recording laws vary by state. The US has two standards:

**One-party consent**: Only one person on the call needs to know it's recorded. You can record without informing the caller. States include Texas, New York, Georgia, and many others.

**Two-party consent**: Everyone on the call must consent to recording. States include California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, and others.

**For contractors**: If you operate in or receive calls from two-party consent states, you need a disclosure. Most platforms let you play an automated message: "This call may be recorded for quality purposes."

Check your state's laws. When in doubt, disclose. The disclosure itself doesn't hurt conversions measurably.

### Using Transcriptions for Quality

Transcriptions turn call recordings into searchable, analyzable text.

**Quality assurance**: Search transcriptions for phrases like "not interested," "too expensive," "already hired someone." These indicate lost opportunities. Why are people calling and not converting?

**Keyword mining**: What language do callers use? If they say "AC not blowing cold" instead of "AC repair," your ad copy and website content should reflect that language.

**Training**: Review transcriptions with your team. How are calls being handled? Are questions answered properly? Is pricing discussed appropriately?

**Lead scoring**: Some platforms offer AI-powered scoring that analyzes transcription sentiment and content to automatically score lead quality.

## Reporting and Optimization

Data without action is useless. Here's what to actually do with call tracking data.

### Which Sources Drive Calls

Your first report should be simple: calls by source, weekly and monthly.

| Source | Calls | Cost | Cost/Call |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| Google Ads | 45 | $2,500 | $55.56 |
| Organic Search | 32 | $0 | $0.00 |
| Google Business Profile | 28 | $0 | $0.00 |
| Facebook Ads | 12 | $600 | $50.00 |
| Truck Wrap | 8 | $150 | $18.75 |
| Yard Signs | 6 | $50 | $8.33 |

This immediately shows where your calls come from and what they cost. Most contractors are shocked by how much free traffic (organic, GBP) they're getting—and how much they're paying for paid traffic that isn't their primary call driver.

### Call Quality Scoring

Not all calls are equal. A 20-second wrong number isn't worth the same as a 5-minute conversation that becomes a $10,000 job.

Set up call quality tiers:

**Qualified calls**: 90+ seconds, caller is a potential customer in your service area
**Unqualified calls**: Under 60 seconds, wrong numbers, spam, service area mismatch
**Booked calls**: Caller scheduled an appointment (track this in your CRM or via transcription keywords)

Now calculate cost per QUALIFIED call, not just cost per call. This metric matters for budget decisions.

### Cost Per Qualified Call by Source

The real metric: what do you pay for calls that could become customers?

If Google Ads generates 45 calls but only 25 are qualified, and you spent $2,500, your cost per qualified call is $100—not $55.56.

If your truck wrap generates 8 calls, 7 qualified, at $150/month, your cost per qualified call is $21.43.

Suddenly the truck wrap looks a lot better than Google Ads for cost efficiency. Maybe you need more trucks. Maybe you need better Google Ads targeting.

This is [how you measure marketing ROI](/blog/marketing-roi-measurement) properly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

After setting up call tracking for dozens of contractors, here are the mistakes I see repeatedly.

**Not tracking Google Business Profile separately.** GBP calls often outnumber website calls for local businesses. If you're not tracking them separately, you're missing a major chunk of your data.

**Using Google's forwarding numbers in call extensions.** Google's numbers give you basic data but don't integrate with recording, transcription, or your CRM. Use your call tracking platform's numbers instead.

**Setting pools too small.** A 5-number pool for a site getting 200 daily visitors means heavy overlap and inaccurate keyword attribution. Size your pool to your traffic.

**Ignoring offline sources.** Truck wraps, yard signs, and door hangers generate calls. Without dedicated tracking numbers, you'll never know how many.

**Not connecting to GA4.** Call data in CallRail and form data in GA4 means no unified view of your conversions. Integrate them.

**Forgetting the recording disclosure.** If you serve customers in California, Florida, or other two-party consent states, you need a disclosure. Set it up during initial configuration, not after you've accumulated thousands of uncompliantly recorded calls.

**Tracking calls without tracking quality.** 100 calls sounds great until you learn 60 were spam, wrong numbers, or outside your service area. Build quality scoring into your process from day one.

**Not integrating with your CRM.** If call data doesn't flow into your CRM, you can't track calls through to closed revenue. You'll know which channels generate calls but not which generate customers.

## Next Steps

Call tracking isn't a one-time setup. It's infrastructure that compounds in value as you accumulate data.

Start with the basics: source-level tracking for your website, Google Business Profile, and offline sources. Get the integrations right from the beginning. Then add keyword-level tracking once you're comfortable with the data.

The goal isn't tracking for tracking's sake. It's making better decisions. When you can see that yard signs generate leads at one-fifth the cost of Google Ads, you invest accordingly. When you can see that certain keywords generate calls that never close, you stop bidding on them.

This is [the analytics foundation](/blog/ga4-setup-home-services) every contractor needs. Phone calls are your revenue. Know where they come from.

    title: 'Plumber Marketing: Digital Strategies That Generate Calls in 2026',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Plumbing marketing operates on different rules than other trades. Emergency calls, 24/7 availability, and trust signals matter more than anywhere else. Here is the complete playbook.',
    content: `
Plumbing is the most unforgiving trade to market. One reason: when someone needs a plumber, they need one now.

A homeowner can wait three weeks for a new roof. They can schedule an HVAC tune-up whenever convenient. But water pouring through their ceiling at 2am? That's a five-minute decision.

This changes everything about how you market a plumbing business. The playbook that works for roofers, electricians, and HVAC companies needs serious modification. Here's what actually works.

## What Makes Plumber Marketing Different

Before diving into tactics, understand the dynamics that shape plumbing marketing.

**Emergency intent dominates.** Over 60% of plumbing searches have emergency intent. "Plumber near me" usually means "I have water everywhere right now." Compare that to "roofing contractor," where most searches are research-based. Your marketing has to capture people in crisis mode.

**Speed wins the job.** When someone searches for an emergency plumber, they're calling whoever answers first. Not whoever has the best website. Not whoever has the most reviews. Whoever picks up the phone. Your marketing can generate the lead, but your operations have to close it.

**Trust is make-or-break.** Plumbers enter homes. They work in bathrooms and kitchens. Homeowners worry about inviting strangers into private spaces. Your marketing needs to build trust fast, before they ever call.

**24/7 availability is expected.** Pipes don't burst during business hours. A plumbing company that closes at 5pm loses the most profitable calls. Your marketing needs to emphasize around-the-clock availability if you offer it.

**Repeat business potential is massive.** A happy plumbing customer becomes a lifetime customer. Drain cleaning, water heater replacement, bathroom remodel, kitchen update. The first emergency call can lead to $50,000 in lifetime value if you deliver.

These realities shape every strategy that follows. Generic contractor marketing advice doesn't account for them. That's why most plumbing companies waste money on tactics that work better for other trades.

## Google Business Profile for Plumbers

Your Google Business Profile might generate more leads than everything else combined. When someone searches "plumber near me" with water flooding their basement, the map pack is what they see.

**Categories that matter for plumbers:**

Primary category: Plumber (not "plumbing service" or "plumbing contractor")

Secondary categories worth adding:
- Drain Cleaning Service
- Water Heater Installation Service
- Emergency Plumber (if available in your area)
- Septic System Service (if you offer it)
- Gas Installation Service (if licensed)

Each category helps you appear in different searches. A separate "drain cleaning" category means you show up when someone searches specifically for that service.

**Emergency availability signals:**

If you offer 24/7 service, make it impossible to miss. Add "24/7" to your business description. Use the "Hours" field to show you're always open. Add the "Emergency services" attribute.

In your Q&A section, seed the question: "Do you offer 24/7 emergency service?" Answer with specifics: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency plumbing service throughout [city] and surrounding areas. Call [number] any time, day or night."

**Photos that build trust:**

Plumbing photos matter more than most trades because homeowners can't easily visualize the work. Upload:

- Team photos (uniformed, friendly, professional)
- Truck photos (clean, branded, equipped)
- Before/after shots of visible work (water heater installations, fixture replacements)
- License and insurance documentation photos
- Any certifications or awards

Aim for 50+ photos minimum. Update weekly with fresh content. Google's algorithm rewards active profiles.

**Weekly posting strategy:**

Post once per week, rotating through:
- Seasonal tips (winterization, summer water-saving)
- Emergency service reminders
- Completed job highlights (with permission)
- Maintenance advice

Nobody reads these posts. But consistent posting signals to Google that you're an active, legitimate business. We've tested this across dozens of profiles. Weekly posters rank better.

## Local SEO for Plumbers

Beyond your Google Business Profile, your website needs to capture location-specific searches. This means [building service and location pages](/services/seo) that target the keywords people actually search.

**Service page structure for plumbers:**

Create dedicated pages for each major service:
- Emergency Plumbing Services
- Drain Cleaning
- Water Heater Installation & Repair
- Sewer Line Services
- Leak Detection & Repair
- Bathroom Plumbing
- Kitchen Plumbing
- Gas Line Services
- Water Filtration

Each page should target specific searches, answer common questions, and include pricing guidance where possible. "Our drain cleaning starts at $99 for simple clogs" qualifies leads and builds trust.

**Emergency keyword targeting:**

Emergency plumbing searches are goldmines. Create dedicated landing pages for:
- Emergency Plumber [City]
- 24 Hour Plumber [City]
- Burst Pipe Repair [City]
- After Hours Plumber [City]

These pages need massive phone numbers, clear "we're available now" messaging, and trust signals front and center. Someone searching at 3am doesn't have patience for walls of text. They need to call immediately and trust they're choosing right.

**Location pages for each service area:**

If you serve multiple cities, each needs its own page. "Plumber in [City]" pages should include:
- Specific neighborhoods you serve
- Your response time to that area
- Any local references or jobs completed
- Emergency availability messaging

Don't just swap city names. Write genuinely unique content. Google detects thin doorway pages and penalizes them.

**NAP consistency is critical:**

Your Name, Address, and Phone number must be identical everywhere:
- Website
- Google Business Profile
- Yelp
- Angi
- HomeAdvisor
- Apple Maps
- Bing Places
- Facebook
- Every directory listing

"123 Main Street" and "123 Main St" are different to Google. Inconsistency hurts rankings. Audit all your listings quarterly.

## Paid Advertising for Plumbers

[Paid advertising](/services/paid-advertising) for plumbers requires understanding the unique economics of emergency versus planned work.

### Google Ads Strategy

Plumbing Google Ads can be expensive. Emergency keywords like "emergency plumber" and "plumber near me" can hit $30-50 per click in competitive markets. But these are also the highest-intent searches you can buy.

**Keyword structure that works:**

High intent (bid aggressively):
- emergency plumber + [city]
- plumber near me
- burst pipe repair
- 24 hour plumber
- water heater repair urgent

Medium intent (bid moderately):
- water heater installation
- drain cleaning service
- plumber + [city]
- sewer line repair

Low intent (bid conservatively or skip):
- how to fix a leaky faucet
- plumbing tips
- DIY plumbing
- plumber salary

**Build your negative keyword list immediately:**

Plumbing searches attract garbage traffic. Add these negatives from day one:
- jobs
- salary
- career
- DIY
- how to
- parts
- supplies
- wholesale
- snake rental
- tools
- training
- license

Check your search terms report weekly for the first month. Every irrelevant search becomes a negative keyword.

**Call-only campaigns for emergencies:**

For emergency plumbing, skip the landing page entirely. Call-only campaigns connect searchers directly to your phone. They searched "emergency plumber near me" at 2am. They don't want to browse your website. They want to talk to someone now.

**Budget reality:**

In most markets, you need $2,000-5,000/month minimum to test Google Ads properly for plumbing. Below that, you won't generate enough data to optimize. If your budget is smaller, focus entirely on Local Service Ads.

### Local Service Ads: The Plumber Advantage

Local Service Ads should be your first paid investment. For plumbers, they're especially powerful.

**Why LSAs work for plumbers:**

The Google Guaranteed badge builds instant trust. When someone's house is flooding, they don't have time to research companies. That badge says "Google verified this company is legitimate."

Pay-per-lead pricing means you only pay for actual contacts, not wasted clicks. A tire-kicker who clicked your ad and bounced? Free. Someone who actually called? You pay.

LSAs appear above regular search ads and organic results. For emergency searches, that top position captures desperate buyers.

**Maximizing LSA performance:**

Response time matters. Google tracks how quickly you answer calls and respond to messages. Slow responders get fewer leads. Set up instant notifications and answer within minutes.

Reviews drive LSA rankings. More reviews with higher ratings mean more visibility. Every happy customer should get a review request the same day.

Budget high and let Google limit. Unlike Search Ads, LSA inventory is limited by search volume. Setting a high budget doesn't mean you'll spend it all. But it ensures you capture every available lead.

**Budget recommendation:**

For plumbers, max out LSA budget before investing heavily in traditional Google Ads. LSAs are lower cost per lead with higher intent. Only expand to Search Ads when you've exhausted LSA inventory.

## Website Essentials for Plumbers

Your website converts visitors into phone calls. Every design decision should support that goal.

**Emergency contact prominence:**

Your phone number should be impossible to miss. Sticky header on mobile. Giant number on every page. Click-to-call enabled. If someone has to search for how to contact you, you've already lost them.

Consider a floating "Emergency? Call Now" button that stays visible while scrolling. For mobile visitors, this single element can increase call rates by 40%.

**Service pages that convert:**

Every service page needs:
- Clear description of the service
- Common problems you solve
- Pricing guidance (ranges are fine)
- Photos of completed work
- Testimonials specific to that service
- Phone number with clear call-to-action
- Response time expectations

A good water heater page answers: What types do you install? What does installation cost? How long does it take? Do you remove the old one? Do you offer same-day service?

**Trust signals everywhere:**

Plumbers enter homes. Homeowners need reassurance. Display prominently:
- License numbers (linked to verification if possible)
- Insurance documentation
- Background check certification
- Years in business
- Number of jobs completed
- Manufacturer certifications
- BBB rating if applicable
- Industry association memberships

These shouldn't be buried on an "About" page. They should appear in your header, footer, and on every service page.

**Mobile-first design:**

Over 70% of "plumber near me" searches happen on mobile devices. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load on a phone, you're losing leads before they see anything.

Test with Google PageSpeed Insights. Fix whatever it flags. Compress images, minimize code, use proper hosting. For emergency searches, every second of load time costs you jobs.

**Online booking option:**

Not every plumber needs online scheduling. But for non-emergency work (drain cleaning appointments, water heater quotes), online booking removes friction.

Add a simple scheduling widget for maintenance and planned work. Keep emergency calls going direct to phone.

## Review Strategy for Plumbers

Reviews are currency. They affect your Google rankings, LSA positioning, and whether a panicked homeowner calls you or the next company.

**Timing matters more for plumbers:**

The right moment to ask for a review is when the crisis is resolved. Water stopped flooding. Hot water working again. Toilet functioning. That's the moment of maximum relief and gratitude.

Ask before you leave the property. "If you're happy with the work, a Google review helps other homeowners find us when they're in the same situation. Here's a link."

Send a text with the direct review link within two hours of job completion. Keep the message simple: "Thanks for trusting us with your plumbing emergency. If you have 30 seconds, a review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"

**Handling negative reviews:**

Plumbing creates more negative review potential than most trades. Stressful situations, expensive surprises, disrupted homes. Expect some negative feedback even when you do good work.

Respond professionally to every negative review. Acknowledge the frustration. Explain what happened if appropriate. Offer to make it right. Keep it brief.

"We're sorry you had a frustrating experience. Our records show the additional repair was necessary because [brief explanation], but we understand that was an unwelcome surprise. Please call us at [number] so we can discuss making this right."

Future customers read your responses as carefully as the reviews themselves. A professional response to criticism can actually build trust.

**Review volume targets:**

Aim for 5-10 new reviews per month. Consistent velocity signals to Google that you're an active, legitimate business. A burst of 50 reviews followed by six months of nothing looks suspicious.

**Platform priority:**

Google reviews matter most for search visibility. But also collect on:
- Yelp (still matters in some markets)
- Facebook (for social proof)
- Nextdoor (hyperlocal recommendations)

Google first, then spread to others.

## Content Marketing for Plumbers

Content marketing works for plumbers, but differently than most industries. You're not building a media empire. You're capturing specific searches and building trust.

**Blog topics that actually rank:**

Focus on problems and questions, not generic advice. Topics that work:

- "How Much Does [Service] Cost in [City]?" - People search this before calling for quotes
- "Signs You Need [Service]" - Captures people researching problems
- "What to Do When [Emergency]" - Ranks for crisis searches, positions you as the solution
- "[Service] vs [Alternative]" - Comparison searches have high intent
- "How Long Does [Service] Take?" - Practical questions buyers ask

Skip generic "5 Tips for Hiring a Plumber" content. Everyone writes that. Nobody ranks for it.

**Emergency content strategy:**

Create comprehensive guides for common emergencies:
- "Burst Pipe at 3am? Here's Exactly What to Do"
- "Water Heater Leaking: Emergency Steps and When to Call"
- "Sewage Backup: Immediate Actions to Protect Your Home"

These pages rank for crisis searches and establish you as the authoritative voice. Include clear calls-to-action: "If you're experiencing this right now, call us immediately at [number]."

**Video content that builds trust:**

Video humanizes your business in a way text can't. Ideas that work for plumbers:

- "Meet Our Team" introduction videos
- "What to Expect During a [Service] Call"
- "How We Handle Emergency Calls"
- Before/after project walkthroughs
- Quick tips for common problems (building credibility, not replacing your services)

Post to YouTube, embed on your website, share on social. One video serves multiple platforms.

## Email Marketing to Existing Customers

Your past customers are your most valuable marketing asset. They already trust you. They'll need plumbing services again. They know other homeowners.

**Maintenance reminder campaigns:**

Set up automated reminders for services that need regular attention:

- Annual water heater flush (sends 11 months after installation)
- Seasonal drain cleaning before holidays (November timing)
- Winterization reminders (October-November depending on climate)
- Water heater age alerts (when approaching 10-year mark)

"Your water heater was installed 9 years ago. Most units last 10-12 years. Schedule an inspection to catch problems before they become emergencies."

**Seasonal campaigns:**

Different seasons create different plumbing needs:

Spring: "Winter's over. Time to check for frozen pipe damage."
Summer: "Vacation coming? Here's how to protect your plumbing while you're away."
Fall: "Winterize your pipes before the first freeze."
Winter: "Frozen pipe? Here's what to do (and our 24/7 emergency number)."

**Referral reminders:**

Twice per year, email your customer list about your referral program. "Know someone who needs a plumber? We pay $100 for referrals that turn into jobs."

Referral leads close at higher rates than any other source. A past customer vouching for you is more powerful than any advertisement.

**Frequency guidance:**

Email past customers once per month maximum. Quarterly minimum. More than monthly becomes annoying. Less than quarterly and they forget you exist.

## Tracking What Works

Marketing without measurement is gambling. For plumbing businesses, proper tracking is especially critical because most leads come through phone calls.

**Call tracking is mandatory:**

Use a service like CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. Assign unique phone numbers to:
- Google Business Profile
- Website organic traffic (dynamic number insertion)
- Google Ads
- Each marketing campaign

Now you know exactly which channels generate which calls. "Last month: 47 calls from GBP, 28 from Google Ads, 15 from organic website traffic."

**CRM attribution:**

Every lead should have a source captured in your CRM. When the job closes, you can calculate true cost per job by channel.

Cost per lead matters. Cost per closed job matters more. A channel with $100 leads that close 50% beats a channel with $50 leads that close 10%.

**Monthly metrics to track:**

- Total leads by source
- Cost per lead by source
- Leads that convert to estimates
- Estimates that convert to jobs
- Average job value by source
- Cost per job by source
- Marketing ROI by channel

Without this tracking, you're guessing which marketing works. Expensive guessing.

## What Works for Plumber Marketing

Plumber marketing comes down to a few fundamentals: being findable during emergencies, building trust before the first call, and converting leads faster than competitors.

The companies that dominate their markets:
- Appear first in local search results (GBP optimization, LSAs, local SEO)
- Answer calls immediately, 24/7
- Build overwhelming trust through reviews and website signals
- Track everything and double down on what works

Most plumbing companies try a bit of everything, measure nothing, and can't tell which marketing actually generates jobs.

Pick the strategies from this guide that match your budget and capacity. Implement them properly. Measure the results. Cut what doesn't work. Scale what does.

I've managed Google Ads accounts for contractors where $2,000 a month generated 40 qualified leads. I've also audited accounts spending $5,000 a month on clicks that never converted.

The difference in cost-per-lead between a well-structured Google Ads account and a poorly managed one. I've seen it firsthand across dozens of contractor accounts.
:::
Google Ads for contractors is a different game than running ads for e-commerce or SaaS. You're targeting a local service area. Your customers are high-intent but skeptical. And phone calls matter more than form fills.

This guide covers everything from campaign structure to bidding strategy. No theory. Just what generates jobs.

## Why Google Ads Works Differently for Contractors

Standard Google Ads advice assumes you're selling nationally, competing on brand, and optimizing for online conversions. None of that applies to contractors.

**Geography defines everything.** Your service area is fixed. A roofer in Austin doesn't care about clicks from Houston. You need geographic precision that most advertisers don't think about.

**Intent is immediate.** Someone searching "emergency plumber" needs help now. Someone searching "roof replacement austin" is getting quotes this week. The buying cycle is compressed, which means your ads need to connect to a phone call fast.

**Phone calls beat form fills.** A homeowner with a broken AC isn't filling out a contact form. They're calling. Your campaigns need to be optimized for calls, not just clicks.

**Trust barriers are high.** You're asking someone to let strangers into their home and write a $5,000 to $15,000 check. Your ads and landing pages need to build credibility instantly.


These constraints shape everything that follows.

:::key
Contractor Google Ads requires location targeting, call tracking, and trust signals that standard e-commerce campaigns do not need. Generic PPC advice will waste your budget.
:::

## Campaign Structure for Contractors

:::warning
The number one mistake I see: dumping all services into one campaign. This forces your emergency repair ads to compete with your installation ads for daily budget.
:::

Most contractors either lump everything into one campaign or create an overcomplicated structure they can't manage. Here's what actually works.

### Search Campaigns vs. Local Service Ads

Start with Local Service Ads (LSAs) if you haven't already. LSAs appear above standard search ads, include a Google Guarantee badge, and operate on a pay-per-lead model. You only pay when someone actually contacts you.


:::tip
Max out your LSA budget before investing heavily in standard search campaigns. LSAs typically deliver leads at $35-75 each for contractors, while poorly managed search campaigns can hit $150+ per lead.
:::
For contractors, LSAs typically outperform standard search ads on cost per lead. Max out your LSA budget before expanding to search campaigns.

Standard search campaigns fill the gaps LSAs don't cover. Long-tail keywords, branded searches, and specific service combinations often get better coverage through search.

### Campaign Organization by Service Type

Separate campaigns by service category. This gives you independent budgets and bidding for each service line.

For an HVAC contractor:
- Campaign 1: AC Repair (high volume, emergency)
- Campaign 2: AC Installation (high value, longer cycle)
- Campaign 3: Heating Services (seasonal)
- Campaign 4: Maintenance Plans (lower intent)

For a roofing company:
- Campaign 1: Roof Repair (emergency, high intent)
- Campaign 2: Roof Replacement (high value)
- Campaign 3: Storm Damage (insurance work)
- Campaign 4: Commercial Roofing (different audience)

Each campaign gets its own budget, so your emergency repair ads don't compete with your replacement campaigns for daily spend.

Within each campaign, create ad groups around specific keyword themes. "AC repair" and "AC not working" go in different ad groups with different ads tailored to each search intent.

## Keyword Strategy

Keywords make or break contractor campaigns. The wrong keywords burn budget on clicks that never convert.


:::pullquote
"I've audited accounts wasting 60% of their budget on informational searches that never turn into jobs. The fix took 30 minutes of negative keyword work."
:::
### High-Intent Keywords That Convert

These keywords indicate someone ready to hire:

**Emergency and immediate need:**
- emergency [service] + [city]
- [service] near me
- 24 hour [service]
- same day [service]

**Service-specific with location:**
- [service] company + [city]
- [service] contractor + [city]
- best [service] in + [city]

**Price and quote oriented:**
- [service] cost
- [service] estimate
- [service] quote
- how much does [service] cost

For a plumber in Denver, high-intent keywords look like: "emergency plumber denver", "plumber near me", "water heater repair denver", "plumber cost denver".

These keywords cost more per click but convert at 3-5x the rate of informational keywords.

### The Negative Keywords List

This is where most contractors hemorrhage money. Without negative keywords, Google will show your ads for searches that will never convert.


:::warning
I reviewed an account last month where 43% of their clicks came from job seekers searching "plumber jobs near me" and "plumber salary." That is $2,100/month in completely wasted spend.
:::
**Add these immediately:**

Employment seekers: jobs, careers, hiring, employment, salary, apprentice, license requirements, training, certification

DIY searchers: DIY, how to, tutorial, youtube, self, myself, own

Supply seekers: supply, supplies, wholesale, parts, materials, depot, lowes, home depot

Non-customers: free, cheap, complaints, lawsuit, scam, reviews (sometimes), images, pictures, videos

Competitors researching: franchise, start a business, marketing, software

Wrong services: If you're a plumber, add HVAC, electrical, roofing, and other trades you don't do.


:::stat 30-40%
A well-maintained negative keyword list can cut wasted spend by 30-40%. That is potentially $600-1,200/month saved on a typical $3,000 budget.
:::
Review your Search Terms report weekly. Add any irrelevant searches as negatives. A well-maintained negative keyword list can cut wasted spend by 30-40%.

### Match Types for Contractors

**Exact match** for your core high-intent keywords. [emergency plumber denver] only shows for that specific search or very close variants.

**Phrase match** for service + location combinations. "plumber in denver" captures "licensed plumber in denver" and "affordable plumber in denver."

**Broad match with caution.** Google's broad match has improved with smart bidding, but for contractors it still pulls in too much irrelevant traffic. If you use broad match, pair it with a robust negative keyword list and monitor search terms daily.

Start with exact and phrase match only. Add broad match later if you need more volume and have the tracking to measure quality.

## Bidding Strategies

Bidding determines how much you pay for each click and how Google prioritizes your ads. Wrong bidding wastes money. Right bidding scales profitably.


:::tip
Start with Manual CPC until you have at least 30 conversions per month. Automated bidding needs data to work. Switching too early lets Google's algorithm guess, and those guesses get expensive.
:::
### Manual CPC vs. Automated Bidding

**Manual CPC** gives you direct control over max bids. Good for: new accounts without conversion data, testing new keywords, tight budget control.

Set manual bids based on estimated conversion value. If your average job is $3,000 and you close 10% of leads, each lead is worth $300. If you convert 5% of clicks to leads, each click is worth $15. Bid below that to maintain margin.

**Maximize Conversions** tells Google to get as many conversions as possible within your budget. Requires conversion tracking to be set up correctly. Good once you have 30+ conversions per month per campaign.

**Target CPA** (cost per acquisition) sets a target cost per conversion and lets Google optimize toward it. Best for mature campaigns with consistent conversion data. Set your target CPA at 20-30% below your maximum acceptable cost to give Google room to optimize.

**Target ROAS** (return on ad spend) optimizes for conversion value, not just volume. Requires conversion value tracking, which most contractors don't have set up properly. Skip this unless you're feeding closed job revenue back to Google.

### Bid Adjustments That Matter

**Location adjustments.** Increase bids in your most profitable service areas. Decrease in areas with lower close rates or longer drive times. A +20% bid adjustment for your core city and -30% for fringe areas focuses spend where it performs.

**Device adjustments.** For contractors, mobile typically outperforms desktop. Emergency searches happen on phones. Consider +15-25% mobile bid adjustments for emergency services.

**Time-of-day adjustments.** If your office closes at 5pm and you can't answer calls, lower bids after hours. If you offer 24/7 emergency service, increase bids overnight when competition drops.

**Ad schedule.** Some contractors see lower quality leads on weekends. Test reducing weekend bids by 15-20% and measure if lead quality improves.

## Budget Allocation

Budget determines your reach. Too little and you can't learn what works. Too much too fast and you waste money on unoptimized campaigns.

### Starting Budgets by Business Size

**Solo operator or small team (1-5 trucks):** $1,500-3,000/month
Start with LSAs at $50-75/day. Add one search campaign for your highest-value service at $30-50/day. Focus on exact match keywords for your core service area.

**Mid-size company (5-15 trucks):** $3,000-7,000/month
LSAs maxed out. 2-3 search campaigns covering primary services. $50-100/day per campaign. Enough volume to test and optimize.

**Larger operations (15+ trucks):** $7,000-15,000+/month
Full campaign structure across service lines. Geographic expansion campaigns. Competitor conquesting. Enough data for automated bidding to work effectively.

These are starting points. Scale based on performance, not arbitrary targets.

### Seasonal Adjustments

Contractor demand fluctuates. Your budget should too.

**HVAC:** Peak summer (AC) and winter (heating). Increase budgets 30-50% during peak seasons. Reduce in shoulder months.

**Roofing:** Spring through fall in most markets. Storm seasons spike unpredictably. Keep budget flexible to capture storm demand.

**Plumbing:** More consistent year-round, with winter spikes for frozen pipes and water heater failures.

Don't maintain the same budget year-round if your demand is seasonal. You'll overspend when demand is low and underspend when it's high.

### When to Scale

Scale budget when:
- Your cost per lead is below your target threshold
- You're capturing less than 50% impression share on converting keywords
- You have capacity for more jobs

Don't scale when:
- You can't handle more leads (answer rate drops, follow-up slows)
- Cost per lead is at or above your threshold
- You haven't optimized current campaigns

Scaling bad campaigns just loses money faster. Optimize first, then scale.

## Ad Copy That Converts

Your ad copy is the first impression. It determines whether someone clicks or scrolls past.

### Headlines That Work

Google now uses responsive search ads. You provide up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions. Google tests combinations.

**Effective headline formulas:**

Service + Location: "Roof Repair in Austin"
Urgency: "Same Day Service Available"
Trust signal: "Licensed & Insured Since 2005"
Benefit: "Free Estimates - No Obligation"
Social proof: "500+ 5-Star Reviews"
Price anchor: "Roof Inspections Starting at $99"

Mix headline types. Include at least one headline with your city name, one with a trust signal, one with a clear benefit.

**Headlines to avoid:**

Generic: "Quality Service" (everyone says this)
Vague: "We're the Best" (prove it instead)
Clickbait: "You Won't Believe Our Prices" (kills trust)

### Extensions to Use

Extensions make your ads bigger and more clickable. Use all of them.

**Sitelinks:** Link to specific service pages. "AC Repair", "New Installation", "Emergency Service", "Financing Options"

**Callouts:** Short trust signals. "24/7 Service", "Licensed & Insured", "Locally Owned", "Free Estimates"

**Structured snippets:** Service types. "Services: Repair, Installation, Maintenance, Inspection"

**Call extensions:** Phone number that shows on mobile. Critical for contractors.

**Location extensions:** Connect to your Google Business Profile. Shows address and map pin.

Ads with extensions get 10-15% higher click-through rates on average.

### Call-Only Ads

For emergency services, consider call-only campaigns. These ads show only on mobile and clicking calls you directly. No landing page in between.

Call-only ads work well for:
- Emergency plumbing
- AC repair in summer
- Furnace repair in winter
- Lockouts

The trade-off: no landing page means no pre-qualification. You may get more calls but lower quality. Test against standard mobile ads.

## Landing Pages for Contractors

Your landing page determines whether clicks become leads. A bad landing page kills even the best campaigns.

### What to Include

**Above the fold:**
- Headline matching the search intent
- Phone number (click-to-call on mobile)
- Clear call-to-action button
- Trust signals (reviews, certifications, years in business)

**Below the fold:**
- Service description matching the ad
- Before/after photos of your work
- Pricing guidance (ranges are fine)
- Process explanation (what happens when they call)
- Full testimonials
- FAQ section

**What not to include:**
- Navigation to other pages (keeps them focused)
- Stock photos (customers can tell)
- Walls of text (nobody reads them)
- Multiple competing CTAs

### Mobile Optimization

Over 70% of contractor searches happen on mobile. Your landing page must work perfectly on phones.

**Requirements:**
- Page loads in under 3 seconds
- Phone number tappable at the top
- Form fields are large enough to tap
- Buttons are thumb-sized
- No horizontal scrolling
- Images compressed for fast loading

Test your landing pages on your own phone. If anything frustrates you, fix it.

Build dedicated landing pages for each major campaign. Don't send all traffic to your homepage. An ad for "emergency roof repair" should go to a page about emergency roof repair, not a generic roofing services page.

## Tracking and Optimization

Running Google Ads without proper tracking is gambling. You need to know which keywords, ads, and campaigns generate actual customers.

### Conversion Tracking Setup

Track these actions:
- Phone calls from ads (use Google forwarding numbers or call tracking)
- Phone calls from website (requires call tracking software)
- Form submissions (Google Ads conversion tracking or Google Analytics)
- Chat initiations if you use live chat

Set up conversion tracking in Google Ads, not just Google Analytics. Google Ads needs this data to optimize bidding.

**Call tracking implementation:**

Use CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. These services provide tracking numbers that record which marketing source generated each call.

Dynamic number insertion shows different tracking numbers to visitors from different sources. Visitors from Google Ads see one number. Visitors from Facebook see another. Organic visitors see another.

This tells you exactly which campaigns and keywords generate calls, not just clicks.

### Call Tracking Integration

Connect your call tracking to Google Ads. This allows:
- Call conversions to feed back to Google for optimization
- Call duration filtering (only count calls over 60 seconds as conversions)
- Keyword-level call attribution

A 15-second call is usually a wrong number or tire kicker. A 3-minute call is a real lead. Track call duration and set minimum thresholds for what counts as a conversion.

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Weekly checks:**
- Cost per conversion (should stay below your threshold)
- Search terms report (add negatives for irrelevant terms)
- Impression share (are you losing to budget or rank?)
- Quality scores (below 5 needs attention)

**Monthly analysis:**
- Conversion rate by campaign
- Cost per lead trend over time
- Device performance comparison
- Geographic performance
- Day and hour performance

**Quarterly review:**
- Overall ROI calculation
- Campaign structure adjustments
- Budget reallocation based on performance
- Seasonal adjustment planning

## The Reality Check

[Google Ads for contractors](/services/paid-advertising) works. But it requires ongoing attention. This isn't set-and-forget marketing.

Budget reality: Expect to spend $2,000-5,000 to learn what works before you're profitable. Consider the first month or two as data gathering.

Time reality: Managing Google Ads properly takes 3-5 hours per week. If you're not willing to invest that time, hire someone who will.

Results reality: Well-managed contractor campaigns generate leads at $30-100 each depending on your market and service. Close 20-30% of those leads and the math works out. If your close rate is low, the problem might not be your ads.

The contractors who succeed with Google Ads treat it as a system. They track everything. They optimize continuously. They connect ad spend to actual jobs closed, not just leads generated.

If you want help setting this up right the first time, [we build these systems](/services/paid-advertising) for contractors. Full tracking, proper campaign structure, ongoing optimization. You'll know exactly which keywords generate which jobs.

But if you're doing it yourself, this guide is the playbook. Follow it step by step, track your results, and optimize based on data. That's how you turn Google Ads from a budget drain into a lead machine.

    content: `
Roofing is one of the hardest businesses to market. Not because it's complicated, but because most marketing advice doesn't account for what makes roofing different.

You're selling something invisible until there's a problem. Your customers don't think about you until water is dripping through their ceiling or a hailstorm just passed through. And when they do need you, they're calling three other companies too.

:::stat 73%
of homeowners contact 3+ roofing companies before making a decision. Your marketing has to make you the obvious choice before they even pick up the phone.
:::

This guide covers 15 strategies that actually work for roofing companies. No theory. Just what generates leads and closes jobs.

I've worked with roofing companies doing $400k and roofing companies doing $8M. The marketing fundamentals are the same. The scale is different.
## Why Roofing Marketing Is Different

Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard marketing advice fails for roofers.

**Seasonality runs everything.** Spring storms create a surge. Winter kills lead flow in most markets. You can't just "run consistent campaigns" and expect consistent results. Your marketing has to flex with demand.

**Storm chasing changed the game.** After major storms, out-of-town crews flood your market. They're knocking doors, running aggressive ads, and competing for the same insurance jobs. You need a strategy that builds local trust faster than they can.

:::warning
After major storms, out-of-town crews flood local markets with aggressive marketing. If you haven't built local trust before the storm hits, you're competing against companies willing to outspend you 10:1 for the same insurance jobs.
:::
**High ticket means high skepticism.** A $12,000 roof replacement isn't an impulse buy. Homeowners research, compare, and worry about getting scammed. Your marketing needs to build trust before they'll even pick up the phone.

**Insurance work adds complexity.** Many roofing jobs involve insurance claims. Your marketing needs to speak to both direct-pay customers and storm damage victims navigating insurance processes. Different audiences, different messages.

Now for the strategies.

## 1. Google Business Profile Domination

Your Google Business Profile is the single most important marketing asset you own. When someone searches "roofer near me" or "roof repair [city]", the map pack results get more clicks than anything else.

Most roofers set up their profile and forget it. That's a mistake.

**Complete every field.** Services, service areas, hours, attributes. Google rewards completeness. Takes 30 minutes.

**Add photos weekly.** Before and after shots of actual jobs. Crew photos. Truck photos. Not stock images. Google's algorithm can identify generic stock photos, and so can customers.

**Post updates weekly.** Nobody reads them, but posting signals to Google that you're an active business. We've tested profiles with weekly posts against identical profiles without. The posting profiles rank higher.

**Optimize Q&A.** Add your own questions and answers. "Do you handle insurance claims?" "Yes, we work directly with all major insurance providers for storm damage claims." Free keyword optimization that competitors ignore.

**Categories matter.** "Roofing Contractor" as your primary category. Add "Roof Inspection Service" and "Gutter Installation Service" as secondary categories if you offer those services.

This alone can put you in the map pack for high-intent local searches. Free leads, recurring monthly.

## 2. Local SEO for "[City] Roofing Contractor"

Beyond your Google Business Profile, you need your website ranking for local searches. This means [building out location and service pages](/services/seo) that target specific keywords.

Every city you serve needs its own page. "Roofing Contractor Austin" is different from "Roofing Contractor Round Rock." These pages need:

**Unique content.** Not the same page with the city name swapped. Write about that specific area. Mention neighborhoods. Reference local landmarks. Google knows the difference between unique content and find-replace.

**Testimonials from that area.** If you have reviews from Round Rock customers, feature them on the Round Rock page.

:::stat 50+
additional organic leads per month is typical for a roofing company serving 8-10 cities with properly built location pages. Tedious work, but the compound returns are significant.
:::

## 3. Google Ads for Roofing

[Google Ads](/services/paid-advertising) for roofing is expensive. CPCs for "roof replacement" can hit $30-50 in competitive markets. But done right, it's also the highest-intent traffic you can buy.

**Start with exact match keywords.** Broad match for roofing is a budget incinerator. Google will happily spend your money on "roofing jobs" (employment seekers), "DIY roof repair" (not hiring anyone), and "roofing materials near me" (contractors, not customers).

**Build a negative keyword list immediately.** Add: jobs, employment, career, DIY, how to, supply, supplies, materials, wholesale, contractor license, training. Review your search terms report weekly and add more.

**Keyword structure that works:**

High intent (bid aggressively):
- roof replacement + [city]
- emergency roof repair
- storm damage roof repair
- roofing company near me

Medium intent (bid moderately):
- roof inspection + [city]
- roof leak repair
- new roof cost

Low intent (bid conservatively or skip):
- best roofing materials
- how long does a roof last
- signs you need a new roof

:::tip
Budget reality: In most markets, you need $2,000-5,000/month to test Google Ads properly. Below that, you don't have enough data to optimize. If your budget is under $2,000, focus on Local Service Ads and SEO instead.
:::

**Landing pages matter.** Don't send paid traffic to your homepage. Build dedicated landing pages for each service. Roof replacement ads go to a roof replacement page with specific pricing information, photos, and a single clear call-to-action.


## 4. Local Service Ads: The Roofing Advantage

Local Service Ads (LSAs) should be your first paid investment. Unlike standard Google Ads, you only pay when someone actually contacts you.

For roofing companies, LSAs have two major advantages.

**Trust signals are built in.** The Google Guaranteed badge means Google has verified your insurance, licensing, and background checks. This immediately differentiates you from storm chasers.

**Pay-per-lead, not pay-per-click.** You're not paying for tire-kickers who clicked an ad and bounced. You're paying for phone calls and messages from people who want to hire a roofer.

**Getting the most from LSAs:**

Response time affects your ranking. Answer calls immediately. Return messages within minutes. Google tracks this.

Reviews heavily influence LSA rankings. More Google reviews with higher ratings means more LSA visibility. This compounds with your organic GBP efforts.

Set your budget by leads, not dollars. Calculate what you can afford to pay per lead based on your close rate and average job value. A $50 lead that closes 20% of the time at $10,000 average job value is wildly profitable.

:::pullquote
"A $50 lead that closes 20% of the time at $10,000 average job value is wildly profitable. That's $1,000 in cost to generate $10,000 in revenue."
:::
The limitation: LSA inventory is limited. You can't just spend more to get more leads like traditional ads. But max out LSAs before investing heavily in standard Google Ads.

## 5. Review Generation That Actually Works

Reviews are currency in roofing. They affect your Google rankings, your LSA positioning, and whether a prospect calls you or your competitor.

The mistake most roofers make: they ask for reviews months after the job, if at all.

**The right timing:** Request the review the same day the job completes, while the customer is still happy about their new roof. Not a week later when they've moved on mentally.


:::stat 10x
higher response rate when you text a direct Google review link vs. sending an email. Text gets opened. Email gets ignored.
:::
**The right method:** Text, not email. A text with a direct link to your Google review page gets 10x the response rate of email. Keep it short: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us for your roof. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"

**The right volume:** Aim for 5-10 new reviews per month. Consistent review velocity signals to Google that you're an active, legitimate business.

**Responding to reviews:** Every single one. Positive reviews get a quick thank you. Negative reviews get a professional response that acknowledges the issue and offers resolution. Future customers read your responses as carefully as the reviews themselves.


:::warning
Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, it looks sketchy, and one customer calling you out for it destroys your credibility. The ask alone is enough if you've done good work.
:::**Never offer incentives for reviews.** It's against Google's terms, it looks sketchy, and one customer calling you out for it destroys your credibility. The ask alone is enough if you've done good work.

## 6. A Website That Actually Converts

Your website's job is to convert visitors into phone calls. Everything else is secondary.

Most roofing websites fail at this. They're slow. They bury contact information. They look like every other roofing site with the same stock photos.

**What converts for roofing:**

Before and after galleries. Real photos of actual jobs you've completed. This is the single most persuasive element on a roofing website. Customers want to see your work, not stock photos of generic roofs.

:::tip
Financing information upfront wins. "$89/month with approved credit" converts better than hiding financing options on a separate page. A $12,000 roof is a lot of money. Make it feel manageable.
:::

Financing information upfront. A $12,000 roof is a lot of money. If you offer financing, say so prominently. "$89/month with approved credit" converts better than hiding financing options on a separate page.

Clear pricing guidance. You don't need exact quotes, but ranges help. "Typical roof replacement in [city]: $8,000-$15,000 depending on size and materials." This qualifies leads and builds trust through transparency.

Phone number visible everywhere. Sticky header with click-to-call on mobile. Phone number on every page. Make it impossible to miss.

Fast load times. Over 70% of searches happen on mobile. If your site takes 5 seconds to load on a phone, half your visitors are gone before they see anything.

Trust signals throughout. Licensing info, insurance badges, manufacturer certifications, years in business, BBB rating. These should be visible on every page, not buried on an about page.

A [properly optimized roofing website](/services/cro) can double your conversion rate from the same traffic. That's twice the leads for zero additional ad spend.

## 7. Storm Damage Content Strategy

Storm damage is where roofing marketing gets seasonal. After a major hail event or windstorm, search volume spikes dramatically. Homeowners need help fast.

**Create content before the storms hit:**

"What to do after a hailstorm damages your roof" - Step by step guide
"How to file a roof insurance claim in [state]" - Insurance process walkthrough
"Signs of storm damage on your roof" - Visual guide with photos
"Storm damage roof repair vs replacement" - Decision framework

This content ranks before the storm. When the storm hits, you're already on page one while competitors scramble.

**Storm-specific landing pages:**

After major events, create dedicated pages. "May 2026 Austin Hailstorm Roof Damage" with:
- Date and affected areas
- What homeowners should do
- Your inspection availability
- Insurance claim assistance info

These pages capture hyperlocal, time-sensitive search intent.

**Social proof from storm work:**

Document your storm response. How many roofs did you replace after the last major storm? Customer testimonials specifically about insurance claim assistance. This builds credibility for the next event.

## 8. Facebook and Instagram for Roofing

Social media for roofing isn't about virality. Nobody shares roofing content. It's about staying visible to people in your service area and retargeting website visitors.

**What works on Facebook:**

Before and after transformations. These perform well visually. Split image showing the destroyed roof next to the beautiful new installation.

Time-lapse project videos. Condense a 3-day job into a 30-second video. People find this surprisingly satisfying to watch.

Team content. Crew photos, company events, community involvement. This humanizes your business against faceless competitors.

Customer testimonial videos. A 30-second clip of a happy customer is more persuasive than any written testimonial.

**Facebook Ads strategy:**

Retargeting first. Someone visited your website but didn't call? Show them testimonial ads for the next 30 days. This is cheap and effective.

Lookalike audiences second. Upload your customer list and target people who match their demographics and behaviors.

Skip broad awareness campaigns. The ROI rarely works for local service businesses.

Budget: $500-1,500/month for retargeting and lookalikes is usually sufficient.

## 9. Nextdoor Marketing

Nextdoor is underutilized by most contractors. It's a hyperlocal platform where neighbors recommend service providers to each other.

**Claim your business page.** This is free. Complete your profile, add photos, respond to recommendations.

**Encourage customers to recommend you on Nextdoor specifically.** After a job, ask: "If you know anyone in the neighborhood who needs roofing work, we'd appreciate a mention on Nextdoor."

**Run local deals.** Nextdoor allows local businesses to promote offers to specific neighborhoods. A "Free roof inspection for [Neighborhood Name] residents" drives leads directly.

**Monitor neighborhood posts.** When someone asks "Can anyone recommend a roofer?", you want to be the one they're recommending. This requires having done good work in that neighborhood already.

## 10. Referral Programs That Work

Word of mouth is still the best marketing. The question is whether you're actively cultivating it or just hoping it happens.

**Structure that works for roofing:**


:::stat $300
referral bonus is the sweet spot for roofing. Big enough to remember and mention to friends. Small enough that it doesn't eat your margin on a $10k+ job.
:::$200-500 referral bonus for customers who refer someone that closes. Cash or gift card, their choice. Make it meaningful enough to remember.

Inform customers during the job. Not after. "If you know anyone else who needs roofing work, we offer a $300 referral bonus." Plant the seed while you're top of mind.

Follow up specifically about referrals. Two weeks after job completion, send a text: "Enjoying your new roof? If any neighbors need work, here's our referral link: [tracking link]"

Track referrals rigorously. Know exactly which customers sent which referrals and pay promptly. A delayed bonus kills future referrals.

**Referral cards work too.** Leave physical cards with customers. "Give this to a friend" with a code that tracks back to them. Old school, but effective.

## 11. Door-to-Door Plus Digital Follow-Up

Door knocking isn't dead for roofing. It's especially effective after storms when homeowners are actively looking for help.

**Modern door-to-door:**

Leave behind more than a card. A one-page handout with: your company info, what to look for on their roof, QR code to your website, and a special offer for that neighborhood.

Capture information, not just appointments. If they're not ready, get their email or phone number for follow-up. "Can I send you information about what to look for with your roof type?"

**Digital follow-up sequence:**

Same day: Text message thanking them for their time, with your contact info.

Day 2: Email with educational content about their roof type or local weather concerns.

Day 5: Second text offering a free inspection.

Day 10: Final email with a time-sensitive offer.


## 12. Video Marketing

Video builds trust faster than any other medium. For roofing, it's especially powerful because customers rarely see what actually happens on a job.

**Drone footage.**

Show completed roof jobs from above. This perspective is stunning and showcases your work in a way photos can't. One drone and a $1,500 investment can create content that differentiates you for years.

Before and after drone shots are particularly effective. Show the damaged roof, then the completed installation.

**Process videos.**

Walk through what happens during a roof replacement. What materials do you use? How does your crew operate? What safety measures do you take? This demystifies the process and builds confidence.

**Inspection videos.**

Record your inspections (with permission). Show homeowners the actual damage you found. This transparent approach builds trust and reduces skepticism about your recommendations.

**Post videos everywhere:**

YouTube (for SEO), Facebook, Instagram, your website. A single video can serve multiple platforms.

## 13. Email Marketing for Past Customers

Your past customers are your warmest leads for referrals and repeat business. But most roofers never email them again.

**What to send:**

Quarterly maintenance tips. "5 things to check on your roof this spring." Genuinely helpful content keeps you top of mind.

Annual anniversary emails. "It's been a year since we installed your roof. Here's what to look for." Subtle reminder that you exist.

Storm alerts. "Major storm headed toward [city]. Here's how to prepare your roof." Shows you're proactive and caring.

Referral reminders. Twice a year, remind them about your referral program.

**Keep the list clean.**

Remove bounces, update addresses, honor unsubscribes. A healthy email list has higher engagement and better deliverability.

Tools: Mailchimp's free tier handles most roofing company needs. Move to ConvertKit or ActiveCampaign if you need more automation.

## 14. Direct Mail for Targeted Neighborhoods

Direct mail isn't dead. For roofing, it works when targeted properly.

**Where it works:**

Neighborhoods with aging roofs. Use property data to identify homes built 15-20+ years ago. Their roofs are approaching replacement age.

Storm-affected areas. After a major weather event, blanket affected zip codes with storm damage information.

Recent move-ins. New homeowners often need roof inspections. Target homes that sold in the last 6 months.

**What to send:**

Not generic postcards. Educational content with clear next steps. "Free Guide: Is Your Roof Storm-Ready?" with a QR code to download it from your website (capturing their email).

Lumpy mail for high-value targets. A dimensional package to a homeowner with a 25-year-old roof in an affluent neighborhood gets opened. Cost per piece is higher, but so is response rate.

**Track rigorously.**

Unique phone numbers or landing pages for each campaign. Know exactly which mailers generate calls.

## 15. Strategic Partnerships

Other professionals regularly interact with homeowners who need roof work. Partner with them.

**Real estate agents.**

Roofs kill deals. Agents need reliable roofers who can inspect quickly and provide honest assessments. Become their go-to recommendation. Offer same-day inspections for transactions. They'll send you consistent referral traffic.

**Insurance adjusters.**

Build relationships with local independent adjusters. They can't officially recommend you, but they can mention that "other homeowners in your situation have worked with..." You become the name they mention.

**Home inspectors.**

Home inspectors find roof issues. They can't do the work themselves. Be the company they recommend. Offer them a referral fee or just ensure their clients have a great experience.

**Other contractors.**

Siding companies, gutter installers, solar installers. You encounter the same customers. Cross-refer when it makes sense.

**How to build these relationships:**

Lunch meetings. Buy them lunch, learn their business, explain how you can help their clients. Do this monthly.

Joint marketing. Co-host an educational seminar with a real estate agent. "Home Maintenance for New Homeowners."

Reciprocate. When you encounter clients who need their services, send them referrals. Relationships work both ways.

## Budget Allocation by Business Size

How should you allocate marketing spend? It depends on where you are.

**Under $500k/year revenue:**

Focus on free channels first. Google Business Profile optimization, review generation, referral program, basic website fixes. Paid budget of $1,000-2,000/month max, focused entirely on LSAs.

**$500k-1.5M revenue:**

Max out LSAs. Add $2,000-4,000/month Google Ads budget. Start systematic local SEO. Allocate $500-1,000/month for Facebook retargeting. Total marketing budget: 8-10% of revenue.

**$1.5M+ revenue:**

Full-channel approach. LSAs maxed. Google Ads optimized. Facebook running. [Content marketing](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) for SEO. Video production. Direct mail for targeting. Email nurturing. Partnership development. Total marketing budget: 10-15% of revenue.

## Measuring ROI: Cost Per Lead vs Cost Per Job

Stop looking at cost per click. Start looking at metrics that matter.

**What to track:**

Cost per lead (CPL): Total marketing spend divided by total leads. For roofing, target $50-150 per lead depending on market.

:::stat 25%
close rate is typical for roofing. That means a $100 cost-per-lead becomes $400 cost-per-job. Know your numbers or you're flying blind.
:::
Cost per estimate (CPE): Marketing spend divided by scheduled estimates. This filters out unqualified leads.

Cost per job (CPJ): The real number. Marketing spend divided by closed jobs. For a company with 25% close rate, a $100 CPL becomes $400 CPJ.

Return on marketing investment: Revenue from marketing-attributed jobs divided by marketing spend. Target 5:1 minimum. 10:1 is excellent.

**How to track:**

Call tracking is mandatory. Use CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, or WhatConverts. Assign unique tracking numbers to each marketing channel.

CRM attribution. Your CRM should capture lead source for every contact. When the job closes, you know which marketing generated it.

Monthly reporting. Create a simple spreadsheet tracking leads, estimates, and closed jobs by source. Update weekly, review monthly, adjust quarterly.

:::warning
Without this tracking, you're guessing which marketing works. And guessing with a $10,000/month marketing budget is expensive.

## What Actually Matters

Roofing marketing isn't rocket science, but it does require understanding what makes roofing different from other businesses.

The companies that dominate their markets do a few things well: they show up when people search, they have overwhelming social proof, they respond faster than competitors, and they track everything.

The companies that struggle try a little of everything, track nothing, and can't tell you which marketing actually generates jobs.

Pick the strategies from this list that match your budget and capacity. Execute them well. Track the results. Double down on what works.

If you want help building out these systems properly, implementing tracking that actually works, or running [paid advertising that generates measurable ROI](/services/paid-advertising), we work with roofing companies. [Reach out](/contact) and we'll audit what you're currently doing.

    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Forget the generic marketing advice. Here are the contractor marketing ideas that actually generate phone calls, backed by data and real implementation details.',
    content: `
Most contractor marketing advice is garbage.

I say this having audited hundreds of marketing setups for roofers, HVAC companies, plumbers, and electricians. The advice floating around online is written by people who've never had to explain to a frustrated contractor why their "content strategy" generated 50 Instagram likes and zero phone calls.

The people writing "10 Marketing Tips for Contractors" have never run a service business. They've never dispatched a crew. They've never sweated a slow season. They're regurgitating the same recycled advice that works for e-commerce stores and SaaS companies, then slapping "for contractors" on the headline.


:::stat 500+
Contractor marketing setups I've audited. The patterns are clear: what works for e-commerce does not work for local service businesses.
:::
Here's what actually works, based on spending real money and tracking real results.


## Google Business Profile: Your Actual Most Valuable Marketing Asset

Your website isn't your most important marketing asset. Your Google Business Profile is.



When someone searches "plumber near me" or "emergency roof repair," the map pack shows up first. Before your website. Before your ads. The map pack.

If you're not in those top three spots, you're invisible to the highest-intent searchers in your market.

**What actually moves your GBP ranking:**

Primary category selection matters more than anything else. "Roofing Contractor" outranks "General Contractor" for roofing searches. Get specific.

Complete every single field. Service areas, hours, attributes, services offered. Google rewards completeness. Your competitors skip half of this.

Post weekly. Not because anyone reads them. Because consistent activity signals to Google that your business is alive. We've tested this across dozens of profiles. Weekly posters rank better than identical profiles that don't post.

Photos of real work. Not stock images. Google's AI can tell the difference. Upload before/afters, team photos, and truck photos weekly. Aim for 100+ photos total.

The Q&A section is free keyword optimization. Add your own questions: "Do you offer emergency roof repair?" Answer them yourself with location keywords: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair throughout Dallas and surrounding areas."

Most contractors set up their GBP once and forget it. That's why beating them isn't hard.

## A Review Generation System (Not Just "Ask for Reviews")

"Ask for reviews" isn't a strategy. It's a wish.

A system is a process that runs automatically and produces consistent results. Here's what that looks like:

:::stat 5-10x
A systematic review process will generate 5-10x more reviews than "asking when you remember." The difference is automation and timing.
:::

**The timing:** Send a review request within 2 hours of job completion. Not the next day. Not a week later. While they're still feeling good about the work.

:::tip
Send the review request within 2 hours of job completion - not the next day. While they are still feeling good about the work, conversion rates are 3x higher.
:::

**The medium:** Text message, not email. Text open rates are 98%. Email open rates are 20% on a good day. A direct link to your Google review page, not your Facebook or Yelp.

**The script that works:**

"Hi [Name], thanks for trusting us with your [service type]. If you have 30 seconds, a quick review helps other homeowners find us: [link]"

That's it. No begging. No "it would really mean a lot to us." Just the ask and the link.

**Automate it:** Every job completion in your CRM triggers the text automatically. Jobber, Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan all support this. If your CRM doesn't, Zapier can connect almost anything.

**Response protocol:** Respond to every review within 24 hours. Positive reviews get a quick, personalized thank you. Negative reviews get a professional response acknowledging the issue and offering to make it right. Future customers read your responses more carefully than the reviews themselves.

This system, running consistently, will generate 5-10x more reviews than "asking when you remember."

## Local SEO Fundamentals That Actually Matter

[Local SEO](/services/seo) for contractors isn't complicated. But agencies love making it sound complicated so they can charge more.

Here's what actually moves rankings:

**Service pages that target real searches.** One page per major service. "Roof Replacement in Austin" is a different page than "Roof Repair in Austin." Each page should target specific keywords, answer specific questions, and have unique content. Not 200 words with the city name stuffed in.

**Location pages if you serve multiple cities.** "HVAC Contractor Round Rock" needs its own page. Include driving directions, local landmarks, and specific service details for that area. Google wants to see you're actually serving these locations, not just claiming them.

**NAP consistency everywhere.** Your Name, Address, and Phone number should be identical across your website, Google Business Profile, Yelp, Angi, and every other directory. "123 Main Street" and "123 Main St." are not the same to Google.

**Citations that matter.** Forget the 200-directory "citation building" packages agencies sell. Focus on: Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook, industry-specific directories (Angi, HomeAdvisor, Houzz), and local directories (Chamber of Commerce, BBB if you're a member). That's roughly 15-20 citations that actually move the needle.

**Website speed on mobile.** Over 70% of "near me" searches happen on phones. If your site takes 5 seconds to load, you're losing leads before they see your content. Test with Google PageSpeed Insights. Aim for under 3 seconds.

Most SEO agencies will overwhelm you with technical audits and hundreds of "issues" to fix. 80% of those issues don't matter. The fundamentals above do.

:::key
For local contractors, GBP optimization, review generation, and NAP consistency will outperform any technical SEO tactics. Focus on the fundamentals first.

## Google Ads with Proper Negative Keywords

[Google Ads](/services/paid-advertising) work for contractors. When set up correctly.


:::warning
Most contractors (or their agencies) set up campaigns with broad match keywords and let Google spend their budget on garbage searches. "Roofing contractor" on broad match will show for "roofing contractor jobs" and "how to become a roofing contractor" - all wasted clicks.
:::
The problem: most contractors (or their agencies) set up campaigns with broad match keywords and let Google spend their budget on garbage searches.

"Roofing contractor" on broad match will show your ad for "roofing contractor jobs," "roofing contractor salary," "how to become a roofing contractor," and "roofing contractor license requirements." All people looking for information, not services. All wasted clicks.

**The setup that works:**

Start with exact match and phrase match keywords only. [roofing contractor austin] and "roofing contractor austin" will show for people actually searching for roofing services. Not the tangentially related searches Google wants to waste your money on.

Build your negative keyword list from day one. Check your search terms report weekly for the first month, then monthly after that. Every irrelevant search gets added as a negative. Jobs, salary, DIY, how to, license, near [other cities], free.

Separate campaigns by service and intent. Emergency searches ("emergency roof repair") have different cost-per-click and conversion rates than non-urgent searches ("roof replacement cost"). Don't lump them together.

**Geographic targeting:** Target your actual service area, not the whole metro. A 30-mile radius is probably right. Adding "service area" locations doesn't help.

**Call-only campaigns for high-intent services.** For emergency HVAC, plumbing, or roofing, skip the landing page. Send them straight to a phone call. These leads are ready to book now.

The contractors who do Google Ads well are checking their search terms reports and adding negatives weekly. The contractors who lose money set it and forget it.

## Local Service Ads (LSAs) for Qualified Leads

LSAs show up above regular Google Ads. The "Google Guaranteed" or "Google Screened" badge builds instant trust. And you only pay for actual leads, not clicks.

If you're not running LSAs, start tomorrow.

**The setup:**

Get through Google's verification process. Background checks, license verification, insurance verification. It takes 2-4 weeks. Start now.

Set your budget based on how many leads you can actually handle. LSAs have limited inventory. If you set a high budget, Google won't necessarily spend it all. But they'll fill what demand exists.

Respond to every lead within minutes. LSAs rank providers partly by responsiveness. Slow response = fewer leads shown. Set up instant notifications to your phone.

**The reality check:**

LSAs aren't infinite. You can't just spend more to get more leads. Google only shows them when people search. In most markets, you'll max out LSA inventory and need other channels for growth.

Lead quality varies. You'll get some time-wasters. Track which leads convert to jobs and which don't. Report bad leads to Google (they sometimes credit them back).


:::pullquote
"LSAs are the highest-intent leads you will get. They show up above everything else, build instant trust with the Google badge, and you only pay when someone actually contacts you."
:::
LSAs are the highest-intent leads you'll get. Start here before anything else.

## Before/After Photos That Convert

Every contractor thinks they have "great photos." Most don't.

What actually works:

**Consistent angles.** Take the "before" from the same spot as the "after." Standing in the same location, same angle, same framing. Side-by-side comparisons that show the transformation clearly.

**Good lighting.** Natural daylight beats flash every time. If you're inside, open the blinds. If the job finishes after dark, come back in the morning for the final photos.

**Context shots.** The wide shot showing the whole project. The detail shot showing quality of workmanship. The before shot showing how bad it was.

**Organized storage.** Every job gets its own folder. Date, customer name (or address), service type. You should be able to find photos from any job within 60 seconds.

**Where they go:**

Google Business Profile (fresh photos weekly). Your website service pages. Social media. Your CRM attached to customer records. Estimates to show prospects what to expect.

A phone camera is fine. You don't need professional photography. You need consistency and volume.

## Video Testimonials from Real Customers

Written reviews are good. Video testimonials are better.

A real customer, standing in front of the work you did, talking about their experience carries weight that written text can't match. It's proof that's hard to fake.

**How to get them:**

Ask at the end of jobs where customers are clearly happy. Not every customer. The ones who say "this looks amazing" or "I can't believe how fast you finished."

Keep it simple: "Would you mind giving us a 30-second video testimonial? Just say what the problem was and how we helped. Takes less than a minute."

Film on your phone. Horizontal orientation. Decent lighting. Not shaky.

**The questions that work:**

"What was the problem you needed solved?"
"How was your experience working with us?"
"Would you recommend us to others?"

Keep videos under 60 seconds. Long testimonials don't get watched.

**Where to use them:**

Homepage. Service pages (roof replacement page gets roofing testimonials). Google Business Profile as video posts. Facebook and Instagram. YouTube Shorts and TikTok if your audience is there.


:::stat 3-5
Three to five strong video testimonials will outperform pages of written reviews. That is all you need to differentiate yourself from 90% of competitors.
:::
Three to five strong video testimonials will outperform pages of written reviews.

## Nextdoor: The Overlooked Platform

Nextdoor is hyper-local. People asking their neighbors for recommendations on home services. High trust, high intent.

**How to work it:**

Claim your business page. Get verified as a local business.

Ask happy customers to recommend you on Nextdoor specifically. When someone posts "looking for a good roofer," their neighbors' recommendations carry serious weight.

Don't spam the neighborhood feed. Contribute useful information. Answer questions about your trade. Be the expert, not the salesperson.

**Neighborhood sponsorship ads:** Nextdoor offers local sponsorship that shows your business in a specific neighborhood's feed. Worth testing with a small budget.

The ROI here is hard to track directly. But in suburban markets especially, Nextdoor recommendations drive significant business.

## Strategic Partnerships with Real Value

Referral partnerships with related trades create recurring lead flow without ongoing ad spend.

**Partnerships that work:**

Roofing + Gutters + Siding. After a roof replacement, the homeowner often needs gutters or siding work. The contractor who did the roof recommending a specific gutter company carries weight.

HVAC + Electrical + Plumbing. New HVAC installation might need electrical work. Plumbing remodels might need HVAC rerouting.

General Contractors + Specialists. GCs need reliable subs they can refer homeowners to for specialized work.

**How to structure it:**

Mutual referral agreement. You send leads to them, they send leads to you. No money changes hands (avoids licensing issues in some states).

Monthly check-ins. Quick call or coffee to maintain the relationship and share what types of jobs you're each looking for.

Clear communication on pricing. Nothing kills a referral partnership faster than your partner's customer complaining about your prices.

**Supplier partnerships:**

The roofing supply house, HVAC distributor, or plumbing wholesaler talks to contractors all day. Some of those contractors get asked for recommendations by homeowners. Be the company suppliers mention.

## A Referral Program With Actual Teeth

"Referral bonus: $50 Visa gift card" doesn't move anyone.

What works: meaningful rewards for meaningful referrals.

**Structure that performs:**

$200-500 for a closed job, not for a lead. Paid within 30 days of job completion. Real money that's worth remembering.

Tiered rewards: $200 for jobs under $5k, $400 for jobs $5-15k, $600 for jobs over $15k. Bigger jobs deserve bigger rewards.

**Make it easy to participate:**

Simple tracking (by name, not by code). "Just tell them Sarah sent you" beats "use referral code SARAH123."

Tell customers about it at job completion. "If you have friends or neighbors who need [service], we pay $300 for referrals that turn into jobs."

Remind past customers quarterly. A text or email to your customer list: "Know someone who needs [service]? We pay $300 for referrals."

**Track obsessively:**

Where did each referral come from? Which customers refer repeatedly? What's your cost per acquisition from referrals vs other channels?

In most markets, referral leads close at 50%+ rates with zero ad spend. Invest accordingly.

## Truck Wraps That Actually Convert

Your trucks are moving billboards you already own. Done right, truck wraps generate calls. Done wrong, they're ignored.

**What works:**

Massive phone number. Readable from 50 feet away. This matters more than anything else.

Clean, simple design. Your logo, phone number, and one line about what you do. That's it. No one's reading paragraphs at 40mph.

High contrast colors. Dark text on light background or vice versa. Low-contrast designs disappear.

Website secondary to phone. URL small at the bottom. Phone number giant.

**What doesn't work:**

Cluttered designs with too much information. Stock photos of smiling technicians. Cute slogans instead of services. Hard-to-read fonts.

**The implementation:**

Use a reputable wrap company. Cheap wraps peel and fade. This is a 5+ year investment.

Full wraps outperform partial wraps. The cost difference is worth it.

Keep trucks clean. A dirty wrapped truck signals "we don't care about details."

Track it: unique phone number on truck wraps so you know what's generating calls from the road.

## Yard Signs Done Right

Basic, but effective when done correctly.

**After every job:**

Ask permission to leave a yard sign for 2-4 weeks. Most customers say yes.

Place at property line, visible from the street, facing traffic flow.

Include: company name, phone number, service completed. "Roof replacement by [Company] | 555-1234"

**High-traffic strategy:**

Ask customers on corner lots or busy streets if you can extend the sign duration. Offer a small discount on future work.

Route your estimates through neighborhoods where you have signs up. "You may have seen our signs on Oak Street."

**Track it:**

Ask how people heard about you. "Saw your sign on [Street]" is free attribution.

Cheap, effective, easy. Most contractors skip it entirely.

## Email to Past Customers

Your existing customer list is underutilized. People who've already paid you money are far more likely to pay you again.

**What to send:**

Seasonal reminders. "Spring is coming - time to check your roof after winter storms." "Summer's almost here - when's the last time you serviced your AC?"

Maintenance offers. Annual HVAC tune-up specials. Gutter cleaning before fall.

New service announcements. "We now offer [service]. As a past customer, you get 15% off."

Referral reminders. "Know someone who needs [service]? We pay $300 for referrals."

**Frequency:**

Once per quarter minimum. Once per month maximum. More than monthly and you become annoying.

**Implementation:**

Collect email addresses on every job. Your CRM should have a field for this.

Use a real email platform (Mailchimp, MailerLite) not your regular inbox. You need to track open rates and stay out of spam folders.

Segment by service. Roofing customers get roofing emails. HVAC customers get HVAC emails.

Email is cheap and effective for repeat and referral business. Most contractors don't do it at all.

## Marketing Ideas That Waste Money

Not everything works. Here's what to avoid:

**Random social media posting.** Posting to Facebook three times a week with no strategy generates nothing. No one's scrolling Instagram looking for a plumber. Unless you're running paid ads with targeting, organic social is brand maintenance at best.

**Cheap SEO packages.** The $299/month SEO agency is submitting your business to spam directories and writing garbage content. You're better off doing nothing. [Real SEO](/services/seo) takes time and expertise. If the price seems too good to be true, it is.

**Lead gen services (Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack).** These can work, but understand what you're buying: shared leads sold to 4-5 competitors simultaneously, often with inflated prices. Calculate your actual cost per closed job, not cost per lead. For many contractors, it's astronomical.

**Billboards.** Unless you're in a very specific situation (highway in your service area, major brand awareness push), billboards are expensive and untraceable. A $3,000/month billboard could fund your entire digital marketing budget.

**Radio/TV for most contractors.** Mass media makes sense when you're trying to reach everyone. Home services usually don't need to reach everyone. They need to reach homeowners in their service area who need their specific service right now. Digital targeting does this better at a fraction of the cost.

Save your money for what works.

## Budget Allocation: How to Prioritize

Your marketing budget determines your strategy, not the other way around.

**$1,000/month plan:**

100% to LSAs and Google Business Profile optimization. Don't split this budget. Concentrate on the highest-ROI channel until you've maxed it out.

Do everything else (review generation, photos, referrals, truck wraps) with time, not money. These cost effort, not dollars.

**$3,000/month plan:**

$1,500 LSAs (or until maxed)
$1,000 Google Search Ads (exact/phrase match, strict negative keywords)
$500 Facebook/Instagram retargeting (people who visited your site but didn't convert)

Plus continued investment in organic: GBP posts, review generation, content for your website.

**$10,000/month plan:**

$3,000 LSAs (likely maxed at this point)
$4,000 Google Search Ads (expanded keywords, geo-targeting tests)
$1,500 Facebook/Instagram (retargeting plus cold audience testing)
$1,500 for professional content, video testimonials, and website improvements

At this level, you should be running incrementality tests. Turn channels off temporarily to measure their true contribution. What happens to lead flow when you pause Facebook? Now you know what it's really worth.

## Measuring What Matters

Marketing without measurement is gambling.

**Track these numbers:**

Leads by source. How many calls, forms, and chats from Google Ads vs LSAs vs organic vs referrals?

Cost per lead by source. Total spend divided by leads.

Estimate rate. What percentage of leads turn into scheduled estimates?

Close rate. What percentage of estimates turn into jobs?

Cost per job by source. This is the number that matters. A channel with expensive leads that close at 80% beats a channel with cheap leads that close at 10%.

Average job value by source. LSA leads might close smaller jobs. Referrals might close bigger ones.

**The monthly report you need:**

One page. Leads, estimates, jobs, revenue, and cost per job by marketing channel. That's it.

If your agency can't produce this report, ask why not. If they give you impressions and reach instead, [read this](/blog/marketing-agency-lying-to-you).

"Turning away jobs in July then laying off technicians in October isn't a business model. It's a rollercoaster. Marketing can flatten the curve."
:::

That's not a business model. That's a rollercoaster.

The solution isn't magic. It's systematic marketing that shifts demand, builds recurring revenue, and captures every emergency call when they happen. Here's how to actually do it.

## The HVAC Marketing Challenge

HVAC has three characteristics that break normal marketing rules.

**Extreme seasonality.** Your phone rings off the hook when the first heat wave hits or the first freeze arrives. The rest of the year, you're fighting for scraps. Google Trends data shows "AC repair" searches spike 400% between May and August compared to winter months. That's not a gentle curve. That's a cliff.

**Emergency vs. planned work.** When someone's AC dies at 2pm on a 98-degree Saturday, they're calling whoever answers first. That's a completely different sale than someone researching new HVAC systems for a home they're building. Different intent, different timeline, different marketing approach.


:::key
A $150 tune-up and a $12,000 system replacement require completely different marketing approaches. Treating them the same means overpaying for one or underinvesting in the other.
:::**Maintenance vs. replacement economics.** A $150 tune-up has a completely different customer acquisition cost tolerance than a $12,000 system replacement. Marketing both the same way means you're either overpaying for tune-up leads or underinvesting in replacement opportunities.

Understanding these dynamics shapes everything that follows. Generic [home services marketing](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) advice needs serious modification for HVAC.

## The Seasonal Marketing Calendar

Stop thinking about marketing as a constant. Think about it as a calendar with four distinct campaigns running throughout the year.

### Pre-Summer AC Prep: March Through May

This is your goldmine for planned work. Homeowners aren't desperate yet. You have time to schedule, upsell, and deliver quality service without emergency pressure.

**What to push:** AC tune-ups, maintenance plan signups, system inspections, indoor air quality services.

**The angle:** "Get ahead of summer. Schedule your AC tune-up before the rush." Fear of being stuck without AC when temperatures hit triple digits is real. Use it.

**Ad messaging that works:** "AC tune-ups fill up fast in May. Book now while you can still choose your appointment time." Scarcity works because it's true. Your schedule will be slammed by June.

**Budget allocation:** Increase Google Ads spend by 50% starting March 1st. This is when cost-per-click is still reasonable but intent is building.


:::stat $75
cost-per-lead for a spring tune-up that converts to an $8,000 system replacement later beats $200 cost-per-lead for an emergency call where the customer is price-shopping three companies.
:::

We've seen contractors who shift 30% of their summer emergency budget into spring prevention campaigns. The math works: $75 cost-per-lead for a tune-up that converts to a $8,000 system replacement six months later beats $200 cost-per-lead for an emergency call where the customer is price-shopping three companies simultaneously.

### Summer Emergency Response: June Through August

This is survival mode with opportunity. You can't manufacture more leads. You can only capture more of the leads that exist.

**What to push:** 24/7 emergency service, same-day appointments, fast response times.


:::warning
When it's 102 degrees and the AC just died, nobody's waiting for your slow site. If your website takes more than 2 seconds to load on mobile, you're losing emergency calls to competitors.
:::**The technical setup that matters:** Your website needs to load in under 2 seconds on mobile. When it's 102 degrees and the AC just died, nobody's waiting for your slow site. They're hitting back and calling the next result.

Implement call tracking with whisper messages so your team knows immediately: "This call is from Google Ads - emergency AC repair." That context helps them answer appropriately.

**Ad strategy shifts:**

Increase your LSA budget to maximum. Local Service Ads dominate emergency searches. When someone searches "AC repair near me," LSAs appear above everything else. You want that top spot.

Add "emergency" and "same-day" modifiers to your Google Search campaigns. "Emergency AC repair" has 3x the conversion rate of generic "AC repair" searches, even though it costs more per click.

Enable ad scheduling to increase bids during extreme weather days. If it's 105 degrees, your cost-per-click ceiling should be higher because conversion rates will be higher.

### Fall Heating Prep: September Through November

Mirror image of spring, different system.

**What to push:** Furnace tune-ups, heating system inspections, carbon monoxide safety checks, humidifier installations.

**The angle:** Safety sells better than comfort for heating. "Make sure your furnace is safe before you turn it on" resonates more than "stay warm this winter."

**Timing nuances:** Start heating campaigns right after Labor Day in northern states, late October in southern states. Match your market's weather patterns.

This is also prime time for system replacement sales. Homeowners who struggled through summer with an aging AC are thinking about replacement before winter hits. Target them with "new system" messaging while the pain is fresh.

### Winter Heating Emergencies: December Through February

Same dynamics as summer, different system. Emergency calls spike during cold snaps.

**What to push:** Emergency heating repair, 24/7 service, no overtime charges for nights/weekends (if you can offer that).

**Weather-triggered campaigns:** Set up automated rules in Google Ads to increase budget when local temperatures drop below 20 degrees. This requires daily monitoring or automated scripts, but the ROI is significant.

We built a contractor a simple Google Apps Script that checks weather APIs and adjusts their daily budget automatically. When a cold snap hits, their ads spend more aggressively. When it warms up, they pull back. That script pays for itself every winter.

## Google Business Profile for HVAC

Your Google Business Profile might generate more leads than your website. Treat it accordingly.

**Multiple service categories matter.** HVAC businesses should use: HVAC Contractor (primary), Air Conditioning Contractor, Heating Contractor, Air Conditioning Repair Service, and Furnace Repair Service. Each category helps you appear in different searches.

**Seasonal posts strategy:** Post weekly, but match content to the season.

March-May: AC tune-up reminders, indoor air quality tips, early scheduling benefits.

June-August: Fast response messaging, 24/7 availability, heat safety tips.

September-November: Heating safety checks, furnace efficiency tips, carbon monoxide awareness.

December-February: Emergency heating availability, no overtime messaging, freeze protection tips.

Google's algorithm favors profiles that post consistently. We've tested this extensively. Profiles posting weekly rank higher in the map pack than identical profiles that don't post.

**Q&A optimization for HVAC:** Seed your Q&A section with questions customers actually ask.

"Do you offer 24/7 emergency service?" - Answer with your availability and response time.

"How much does an AC tune-up cost?" - Answer with your pricing or price range.

"Do you service [neighboring city]?" - Answer with your full service area.

"What brands do you install?" - List your brand partnerships.

These Q&As show up in your profile and contain keywords that help you rank. Free SEO that takes 20 minutes to set up.

## Local SEO for HVAC

Beyond Google Business Profile, your website needs location-specific pages that capture searches in every city you serve.

**Service + Location page structure:**

Create pages for each service in each major city. Not thin doorway pages. Actual content.

"AC Repair in [City]" should include: specific neighborhoods you serve in that city, your response time to that area, any local references or completed jobs, and genuinely useful information about AC problems common in that area.

The page for "AC Repair in Phoenix" should mention monsoon season dust affecting condensers. The page for "AC Repair in Minneapolis" should mention preparing systems for temperature swings. Local relevance beats generic content.

**Emergency keyword targeting:**

Build pages specifically for emergency searches. "Emergency AC Repair [City]" and "24 Hour Furnace Repair [City]" are different searches than standard service searches. They deserve dedicated pages.

These pages should emphasize: response time, after-hours availability, phone number prominently displayed, and trust signals (insurance, licensing, reviews). Someone searching at 11pm needs to trust you fast.

**Technical implementation:**

Each location page needs:
- Unique title tag: "AC Repair in [City] | [Company Name]"
- Unique meta description mentioning the city and your key differentiator
- Schema markup with LocalBusiness type and the city's address/service area
- Internal links to your main service pages and other nearby location pages

Proper [SEO implementation](/services/seo) compounds over time. Location pages we built for contractors two years ago still generate leads today without additional ad spend.

## Paid Advertising Strategy for HVAC

[Paid advertising](/services/paid-advertising) for HVAC requires understanding the economics of each service type.

### Google Ads Seasonal Budgets

Here's a budget framework based on what we've seen work:

**Base monthly budget:** Whatever you're comfortable spending during slow months.

**Shoulder seasons (March-May, September-November):** 150% of base. Competition is lower but intent is building.

**Peak seasons (June-August, December-February):** 200-250% of base. Yes, cost-per-click is higher. But conversion rates and job values are also higher.

**Off-peak (the weird in-between weeks):** 75% of base. Maintain presence without bleeding money.

Build this into your annual marketing budget from the start. The contractor who plans for $15,000 in July ad spend doesn't panic when costs spike.

### Local Service Ads for HVAC

LSAs should be your first investment, not your last.

The math: LSAs charge per lead, not per click. For HVAC, that's typically $25-75 per lead depending on your market. A qualified emergency AC lead that converts to a $400 repair job or a $12,000 system replacement? That's exceptional ROI.

**LSA optimization tips:**


:::tip
Respond to every LSA lead within 5 minutes. Google tracks response time and rewards fast responders with more leads. Slow response = fewer leads.
:::Respond to every lead within 5 minutes. Google tracks response time and rewards fast responders with more leads.

Complete every field in your LSA profile. License numbers, insurance verification, service areas. Google shows more complete profiles more often.

Collect reviews specifically to your Google profile. LSA rankings weight review count and recency heavily.

Set your LSA budget high and let Google limit your spend based on lead availability. Unlike Search Ads, you won't waste money on clicks that don't convert.

### Facebook Ads for Maintenance Agreements

Facebook doesn't work for emergency services. Nobody's scrolling Instagram thinking "I should find an emergency HVAC company."

But Facebook excels at maintenance agreement promotion.

**The campaign structure:**

Target: Homeowners in your service area, ages 35-65, with interests in home improvement, home ownership, or specific home-related pages.

Message: "Stop emergency AC repairs before they happen. Our maintenance plan includes two annual tune-ups, priority scheduling, and 15% off repairs. $199/year."

The goal isn't immediate conversion. It's getting people to your landing page and into your remarketing audience. Then you follow up with email, retargeting ads, and phone calls to close the maintenance plan sale.

:::stat $80,000+
in predictable annual revenue from 400+ maintenance agreement customers built over 18 months. Plus the system replacement opportunities that come from regular customer contact.
:::

We've seen contractors build 400+ maintenance agreement customers over 18 months using this approach. That's $80,000+ in predictable annual revenue, plus the system replacement opportunities that come from regular customer contact.

## Building Recurring Revenue Through Marketing

Maintenance plans are the path to schedule stability. Marketing should drive plan signups as aggressively as it drives service calls.

### Maintenance Plan Promotion

**Website placement:** Your maintenance plan should have its own dedicated page with clear pricing, benefits, and signup form. Link to it from every service page.

**Point-of-service promotion:** After every repair call, your technicians should mention the maintenance plan. "This repair was $350. If you'd had our maintenance plan, you'd have gotten 15% off, and we probably would have caught this during your tune-up."

**Seasonal campaigns:** Run maintenance plan promotions in shoulder seasons when you have capacity. "Sign up in March, get your first tune-up free" moves the needle.

### Email Marketing to Existing Customers

Your customer list is gold. Most contractors ignore it.

**Quarterly seasonal emails:**

March: "Summer's coming. Schedule your AC tune-up."
June: "Beat the heat. Our emergency line is available 24/7."
September: "Don't get caught in the cold. Book your furnace inspection."
December: "Thank you for a great year. Here's a special offer for loyal customers."

**Maintenance reminder automation:**

When a customer gets a tune-up, mark the date. 10 months later, send an automated email: "It's almost time for your annual AC tune-up. Click here to schedule."

This is basic email automation. Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or your CRM can handle it. Setup takes an afternoon. The leads it generates are nearly free.

### Seasonal Reminder Campaigns

Text messages work better than email for time-sensitive reminders.

"Hi [Name], this is [Company]. Temperatures are dropping fast this week. Want us to schedule your furnace check before the rush? Reply YES for available times."

:::stat 30%+
response rates on weather-triggered text campaigns vs 2% email open rates for generic newsletters. Text wins for time-sensitive seasonal reminders.
:::

## Website Optimization for HVAC

Your website has specific requirements for HVAC that generic web design ignores.

### Emergency Contact Prominent

When someone's HVAC fails, they're not reading your blog. They're looking for a phone number.

**Implementation requirements:**

Phone number in the header. Visible without scrolling on every page. Click-to-call enabled on mobile.

"Emergency Service" button in the navigation. Bright color. Links to either a phone call or a page with emergency-specific information and a phone number.

Sticky header on mobile that follows the user down the page. The phone number should never disappear.

:::key

:::
Live chat or callback widget for users who prefer not to call. Some people want to type "my AC isn't working" rather than explain it verbally.

### Financing Options

HVAC system replacement is a $8,000-15,000 decision. Most homeowners can't write that check casually.

**What to include:**

Dedicated financing page explaining your options (Wells Fargo, GreenSky, Synchrony, whatever you use).

Monthly payment estimates on system replacement pages. "$12,000 system or $189/month for 72 months" is easier to process than a raw price.

"Financing available" messaging on service pages. Even if they're looking at repairs now, knowing financing exists plants a seed for future replacement conversations.

### Service Area Clarity

"We serve the greater metro area" is useless. List specific cities.

Create a service area page with every city and neighborhood you cover. This helps SEO and helps users immediately know if you can help them.

Include a map if possible. Visual confirmation matters.

## Tracking and Attribution

Without proper tracking, you're guessing. And your guesses are probably wrong.

### Call Tracking for Emergency vs. Planned

Different call sources require different handling.

**Setup structure:**

One tracking number for your Google Ads campaigns.
One tracking number for Google Business Profile.
One tracking number for organic website visitors.
One tracking number for Facebook.
Dynamic number insertion on your website that swaps numbers based on traffic source.

**Call categorization:**

Tag calls as emergency vs. scheduled during or after the call. Your phone tracking software (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics) can add tags.

Over time, you'll see patterns. Maybe Google Ads generates 80% emergency calls. Maybe organic traffic generates more scheduled maintenance requests. That data shapes where you spend.

### Lead Source by Season

Build a simple dashboard that shows lead sources by month.

You'll likely discover that certain channels dominate certain seasons. LSAs might generate 60% of your summer leads but only 30% in spring. Organic might provide consistent year-round traffic while paid varies dramatically.

This informs budget allocation. If organic provides your shoulder-season floor, protect your [SEO investment](/services/seo). If LSAs dominate peaks, make sure your profile is optimized before each peak season starts.

**Attribution to closed jobs:**

The real insight comes from tracking which leads become customers.

Integrate your call tracking with your CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber). When a job closes, you should be able to trace it back to the original marketing source.

A $12,000 system replacement that came from organic search has a different value than a $150 tune-up from a Facebook ad. Your marketing decisions should reflect that difference.

## Making This Work

HVAC marketing isn't set-it-and-forget-it. The companies that dominate their markets adjust constantly.

**Weekly tasks:**
- Review call volume and lead sources
- Adjust ad budgets based on weather forecasts
- Post to Google Business Profile
- Respond to reviews

**Monthly tasks:**
- Analyze cost-per-lead by channel
- Review which services are generating the most interest
- Update ad copy for seasonal relevance
- Send customer email campaign

**Quarterly tasks:**
- Full marketing ROI analysis
- Budget reallocation based on performance
- Website content updates for seasonal keywords
- Maintenance plan promotion campaign

**Annually:**
- Set marketing budget by month based on historical performance
- Plan major campaigns for each season
- Review and refresh location pages
- Analyze year-over-year performance

The contractors who build these rhythms into their operations stop having feast-or-famine years. They still have busy seasons and slow seasons. But the extremes flatten out.

## What Comes Next

This is a lot to implement. Most contractors won't do it all. That's fine. Start with what matters most for your situation.

If your phone doesn't ring in spring: Focus on maintenance plan promotion and seasonal email campaigns.

If you're losing emergency calls to competitors: Fix your website speed, LSA optimization, and call response time.

If you don't know what's working: Set up proper tracking first. Every other decision depends on it.

If you want help building this system instead of figuring it out yourself, that's what we do. We've built HVAC marketing programs that generated 40%+ year-over-year growth by systematically addressing each season's opportunities.

    title: 'Local SEO for Contractors: The Complete 2026 Guide',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most contractors are invisible to homeowners searching online. Here\'s the technical playbook to fix that—from Google Business Profile hacks to schema markup that actually moves rankings.',
    content: `
I've watched contractors spend $50,000 on trucks with phone numbers plastered on the side while their Google Business Profile sits empty. The truck reaches maybe 200 people a day. Google reaches everyone in their service area actively searching for what they sell.

Local SEO for contractors isn't the same as local SEO for restaurants or retail stores. You don't have a storefront customers walk into. You serve a geographic area, not a point on a map. Your trust signals matter more because you're asking people to let strangers into their homes.

This guide covers what actually works for service area businesses in 2026. Not theory. Not "best practices" copied from articles about coffee shops. Tested strategies from contractors who went from invisible to booked solid.

## Why Local SEO Is Different for Contractors

Before we get into tactics, you need to understand why standard local SEO advice often fails contractors.

**You're a service area business, not a storefront.**

Most local SEO guides assume customers will visit your location. For contractors, the opposite is true—you go to them. This changes how Google treats your business and how you should optimize.

Google Business Profile gives you two options: show your address or hide it. If customers don't visit your location, hide it. Showing your garage or home address looks unprofessional and can create security issues. More importantly, it confuses Google about your actual service area.

**Trust is the product.**

Someone hiring a restaurant is risking $50 on a bad meal. Someone hiring a contractor is risking $15,000 and their home's integrity. The trust bar is higher.

Your local SEO strategy needs to account for this. Reviews matter more. Photos matter more. Everything that signals legitimacy and professionalism matters more.

**Competition is hyperlocal.**

You're not competing with every contractor in the country. You're competing with 10-20 other businesses serving your specific area. Understanding exactly who shows up in the map pack for your target searches—and why—is essential.

## Google Business Profile Optimization for Contractors

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is probably worth more than your website for local leads. When someone searches "roofer near me," the map pack shows up first. Your website might not even appear above the fold.

Most contractors set up their profile once and forget it. That's leaving money on the table.

**Primary Category Selection**

This is the single most important field in your profile. Google uses your primary category to determine which searches you're relevant for.

Be specific. "Roofing Contractor" beats "Contractor." "HVAC Contractor" beats "Home Improvement." If Google offers a category that exactly matches your primary service, use it.

Here's what contractors often get wrong: they pick a broad category hoping to rank for more searches. The opposite happens. Google shows more specific businesses first.

**Secondary Categories**

Add every relevant secondary category. A roofing contractor might add: Gutter Cleaning Service, Siding Contractor, Roof Inspection Service. These won't hurt your primary rankings and can help you show up for related searches.

**Service Area Configuration**

For service area businesses, your service area radius directly affects where you rank. Google won't show you in searches from areas you don't serve.

Be honest but strategic. If you'll drive an hour for a good job, include that radius. But if you've defined your service area as the entire state, Google gets confused about where to prioritize showing you.

We typically recommend 20-30 miles for most contractors, adjustable based on your actual willingness to travel. You can list specific cities instead of a radius if that's more accurate.

**Photos That Move the Needle**

:::warning
Stock photos do nothing. Google knows the difference. Customers know the difference. I've seen contractors lose rankings simply because their competitors started posting real job photos while they stuck with generic images.
:::

What works:

Job site photos showing work in progress. Before and afters. These demonstrate you actually do the work you claim.

Team photos. Real humans in company shirts. Names are optional but helpful. This humanizes your business.

Equipment and trucks. Shows you're legitimate and equipped for the job.

Finished projects that look professional. High quality, well-lit, showcasing your best work.

Upload at least 10 photos to start. Add 2-3 new photos monthly. Google rewards fresh content, and newer photos often display first.

**Posts: The Signal That Matters**

GBP posts rarely generate direct traffic. Almost nobody reads them. So why bother?

Because posting signals to Google that your business is active. We've tested this extensively across dozens of contractor profiles. Regular posting correlates with better map pack rankings.

Post weekly. Content doesn't need to be revolutionary. A completed project, a seasonal tip, a service highlight. Keep it under 300 words with an image.

**Q&A: Free Keyword Optimization**

Here's something most agencies don't tell you: you can ask and answer your own questions on your GBP.

Add questions your customers actually ask, then answer them thoroughly:

Q: "Do you offer emergency roof repair services?"
A: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout [City] and surrounding areas. Call us any time for storm damage, major leaks, or other roofing emergencies."

This puts keywords in your profile that help you rank for those specific searches. Add 5-10 Q&As covering your main services and common customer concerns.

## Review Strategy for Contractors

Reviews are the most visible trust signal in local search. More reviews and higher ratings correlate strongly with map pack rankings and conversion rates.

But the "how" matters as much as the "how many."

**When to Ask**

Timing is everything. Ask immediately after job completion while the customer is still feeling good about the work. Not next week. Not in a follow-up email they'll ignore.

The moment you complete the walkthrough and they express satisfaction, that's the ask. Or within 30 minutes via text.

**How to Ask Without Being Sleazy**

Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, and it undermines the trust reviews are supposed to build.

The script that works:

"Thanks for choosing us for this project. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review really helps other homeowners find us. I can text you the link right now."

Then text the direct review link. Not your website. Not "find us on Google." The actual link that opens the review form.

To get your direct review link, search your business on Google, click your profile, click "Reviews," then click "Write a Review." Copy that URL. Or use a shortlink service to make it cleaner.

**Review Velocity Matters**

Google pays attention to how consistently you generate reviews, not just your total count. A business with 50 reviews that got them all two years ago looks less relevant than a business with 30 reviews that got 3 in the last month.

Build review requests into your post-job process. Every job should include a review ask. Aim for 2-5 new reviews monthly minimum.

**Responding to Negative Reviews**

You'll get negative reviews. Some deserved, some not. Your response matters more than the review itself.

Future customers read your responses carefully. They're looking to see: Are you defensive? Do you blame the customer? Or do you handle criticism professionally?

Response framework:

1. Thank them for the feedback (even if it stings)
2. Acknowledge the issue without admitting fault inappropriately
3. Take the conversation offline: "Please contact us at [phone] so we can make this right."
4. Keep it short and professional

Never argue. Never get defensive. Never reveal private details about the job. The response is for the audience watching, not the angry reviewer.

## Citations That Actually Move the Needle

"Citation building" used to mean getting listed on 500 random directories. That stopped working years ago.

Today, citations matter for two reasons: sending referral traffic and validating your business information to Google. Quality beats quantity.

**The Core 20 That Matter**

Start with these and don't waste time beyond them until they're perfect:

*Aggregators and Data Providers:*
Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook Business

*General Directories:*
Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB (if member), Manta, Foursquare

*Industry-Specific:*
Angi (formerly Angie's List), HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Houzz, Porch, BuildZoom

*Trade-Specific* (varies by industry):
For roofers: RoofingContractor.com, GAF contractor finder
For HVAC: HVAC.com, carrier/brand directories
For plumbers: Plumber.com, trade associations

*Local:*
Chamber of Commerce, local business associations, city directories

**NAP Consistency Is Non-Negotiable**

NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number. These must be identical everywhere. Not similar. Identical.

"123 Main Street Suite 100" and "123 Main St. Ste. 100" are different to Google. Pick one format and use it everywhere.

Audit your existing citations before building new ones. Tools like BrightLocal or Whitespark can help identify inconsistencies. Or do it manually—search your business name and check each listing.

Common mistakes: old addresses that were never updated, multiple phone numbers from call tracking gone wrong, business names that include unnecessary keywords ("Bob's Roofing - #1 Austin Roof Repair").

## On-Page Local SEO

Your website supports your Google Business Profile, not the other way around. But it still needs proper optimization to rank in organic results and convert the traffic GBP sends you.

**Location Page Structure**

If you serve multiple cities, each one gets its own page. "Roofing in Austin" is different from "Roofing in Round Rock." Google treats them as separate search intents.

Structure for location pages:

URL: /roofing/austin or /service-areas/austin

H1: Roofing Contractor in Austin, TX (or similar)

Content: Unique content about serving that specific area. Mention neighborhoods, landmarks, local context. This isn't duplicate content with city names swapped—it's genuinely different pages.

Include: Service list, contact information, reviews from customers in that area if possible, photos from jobs in that area.

The minimum viable location page is about 500 words. Better ones run 800-1,200 with genuine local value.

**Service + Location Combinations**

For larger service areas, create pages for service + location combinations:

/roof-replacement/austin
/roof-repair/round-rock
/emergency-roofing/cedar-park

This captures long-tail searches and gives you more ranking opportunities. A search for "roof repair round rock" will favor a page specifically about roof repair in Round Rock over a generic roof repair page.

Priority: create these for your highest-value services first, then expand based on search volume and competition.

**Schema Markup for Local Business**

Schema is structured data that helps Google understand your business. It's invisible to visitors but important for search.

At minimum, implement LocalBusiness schema on your homepage and location pages. This should include:

- Business name
- Address (or service area)
- Phone number
- Hours
- Service type
- Geographic area served
- Aggregate rating (if you have reviews on your site)

Here's what the JSON-LD should look like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "RoofingContractor",
  "name": "Your Company Name",
  "telephone": "+1-512-555-1234",
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "GeoCircle",
    "geoMidpoint": {
      "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
      "latitude": 30.2672,
      "longitude": -97.7431
    },
    "geoRadius": "30 mi"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "reviewCount": "127"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Use the most specific @type for your business. Google has types for RoofingContractor, Plumber, HVACBusiness, Electrician, and more. Check schema.org for the full list.

Test your schema with Google's Rich Results Test. Fix any errors. Invalid schema can hurt more than help.

For more help with technical implementation, [our SEO services](/services/seo) include full schema setup and validation.

## Link Building for Contractors

Links remain one of the strongest ranking factors, but building them for local service businesses works differently than for tech companies or publishers.

**Local Opportunities**

Your existing business relationships are link opportunities:

*Suppliers and distributors:* Many have "find a contractor" or dealer locator pages. If you buy from them, ask about getting listed.

*Manufacturer programs:* GAF, Owens Corning, Carrier, Trane—major manufacturers have contractor networks with website listings.

*Local business associations:* Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, industry-specific groups. Membership often includes a directory listing.

*Partners:* Do you refer work to or receive work from other contractors? Link exchanges between complementary businesses (roofer and gutter installer, HVAC and electrician) are natural and valuable.

**Sponsorships That Pass Value**

Sponsoring little league teams is great for community relations. But does it help SEO?

Only if you get a link from a website with real authority. The $500 banner at the baseball field does nothing for Google. The $500 sponsorship that gets you a do-follow link from the school district's website? That moves the needle.

Look for sponsorship opportunities that include website mentions: local events, charity runs, school programs, community organizations. Ask specifically about website recognition, not just logo placement on physical materials.

**Content That Earns Links Naturally**

Contractors rarely do content marketing well, which means opportunity for those who do.

Create local resources people actually want to link to:

- "How to Prepare Your [City] Home for Hurricane Season"
- "Average Cost of [Service] in [City]: 2026 Data"
- "Complete Guide to [City] Building Permits for [Project Type]"

Local journalists and bloggers link to useful local resources. Generic "5 Tips for Hiring a Roofer" content gets ignored.

For a deeper dive into content strategy for contractors, our [home services marketing guide](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) covers this extensively.

## Tracking Local SEO Success

You can't improve what you can't measure. Most contractors have no idea if their SEO is working.

**Google Business Profile Insights**

Your GBP dashboard shows: search queries that triggered your listing, views, direction requests, phone calls, website clicks.

This data is directional, not perfect. Google aggregates and sometimes delays it. But month-over-month trends tell you if you're moving up or down.

Key metrics to track monthly:
- Total searches your profile appeared in
- Direct searches (people searching your business name)
- Discovery searches (people searching for what you offer)
- Phone calls from profile
- Website visits from profile
- Direction requests

**Rank Tracking by Location**

Where you rank depends on where the searcher is located. Someone in downtown Austin sees different results than someone in Round Rock, even for the same search.

Use a rank tracking tool that checks from multiple locations in your service area. BrightLocal, LocalFalcon, and GeoRanker all do this. They'll show you a grid of your rankings across different points in your territory.

Track your main keywords weekly. Look for patterns: strong in some areas, weak in others. This tells you where to focus optimization.

**Call Tracking Attribution**

If you're not tracking which marketing generates which phone calls, you're guessing.

Use a call tracking service (CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, WhatConverts) to assign unique phone numbers to different channels. Your GBP listing gets one number. Your website organic traffic gets another (via dynamic insertion). Your paid ads get another.

Now you know: "Last month, 47 calls from GBP, 23 from organic search, 12 from Google Ads."

One caution: too many tracking numbers can create NAP inconsistency issues. Use dynamic number insertion on your website rather than hard-coding multiple numbers.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

After working with dozens of contractors on local SEO, the same mistakes show up repeatedly.

**Hiding the address when customers can visit.**

If you have a showroom or office customers can come to, show your address. Hiding it makes you look illegitimate and limits your ranking potential.

**Service area too broad or too narrow.**

Too broad (entire state) and Google doesn't know where to show you. Too narrow (one zip code) and you miss opportunities. Match it to your actual service willingness.

**Keyword stuffing the business name.**

"Bob's Roofing | Best Austin Roofing Company | Emergency Roof Repair" isn't your business name. Google knows it, and this can get your listing suspended. Use your actual business name only.

**Ignoring profile completeness.**

Every empty field is a missed opportunity. Fill out services, attributes, hours, Q&A, photos—all of it.

**One-and-done mindset.**

GBP isn't "set it and forget it." Regular updates, fresh photos, new reviews, and weekly posts signal an active business.

## Next Steps

Local SEO for contractors comes down to a few fundamentals: a fully optimized Google Business Profile, consistent NAP across quality citations, a review generation system, and a website that supports it all.

The contractors who dominate the map pack in their area do these basics consistently. They don't chase shortcuts. They build the machine and keep it running.

    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Service businesses face unique measurement challenges: phone calls, long sales cycles, and offline conversions. Here\'s the developer-led approach to tracking what actually matters.',
    content: `
Most businesses measure marketing ROI wrong. Service businesses measure it completely wrong.

The problem isn't math. The formula is simple: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost. Any spreadsheet can handle that.

The problem is getting accurate numbers to plug into the formula. For service businesses, that's brutally hard.

An e-commerce company knows exactly which ad generated which sale. Click, purchase, done. You run a roofing company? Someone might find you on Google, call three weeks later, schedule an estimate, think about it for a month, then sign a contract. Good luck attributing that cleanly.

This guide breaks down how to actually measure marketing ROI when your business doesn't fit the standard playbook. It's technical in places because the solutions are technical. That's the point.

## Why Marketing ROI Is Harder for Service Businesses

Let's be honest about what you're up against.

**Long sales cycles destroy simple attribution.** A homeowner researches HVAC companies for weeks before calling anyone. They might visit your site five times from different devices. When they finally call, which visit gets credit? Most tracking systems will say "direct traffic" because too much time passed since their first click.

**Phone calls are a black hole.** For most service businesses, 60-80% of leads come through phone calls. Standard Google Analytics doesn't track phone calls at all. You're measuring 20% of your leads and pretending it's 100%.

**Offline conversions matter most.** The lead isn't the goal. The signed contract is. But most businesses can't connect their marketing data to their actual closed jobs. They optimize for leads, not revenue.

**Multi-touch journeys are the norm.** Your customer might see a Facebook ad, search for you on Google two weeks later, read a blog post, then call after seeing your truck in their neighborhood. Every touchpoint mattered. None of them get full credit.

If your marketing reports can't account for these realities, you're making budget decisions based on incomplete data. That's expensive.

## Metrics That Matter vs. Vanity Metrics

Let's separate signal from noise.

**Vanity Metrics (Stop Reporting These)**

Impressions. Your ad appeared on a screen. So what? A billboard has impressions too.

Click-through rate. Higher is better, but a 5% CTR that generates zero jobs is worse than a 1% CTR that generates fifty.

Social media followers. Unless you're monetizing influence, follower count is a distraction.

Website traffic. More traffic means nothing if it doesn't convert. I've seen businesses triple their traffic while their lead count stayed flat.

**Metrics That Actually Matter**

Cost per lead. Total marketing spend divided by total leads. This is your baseline.

Cost per qualified lead. Same calculation, but only counting leads that meet basic criteria: in your service area, need a service you offer, have budget authority. This is more useful than raw cost per lead.

Cost per estimate/appointment. How much are you spending to get someone on the schedule? This matters for service businesses where the estimate is a critical conversion point.

Cost per job. Total marketing spend divided by closed jobs. This is the metric most businesses can't calculate but desperately need.

Customer lifetime value (LTV). What's a customer worth over their entire relationship with you? An HVAC customer who comes back for maintenance and eventually buys a new system is worth far more than a one-time repair.

Marketing-attributed revenue. Total revenue from jobs that originated from marketing activities. When you can calculate this, you can calculate true ROI.

For most service businesses, the goal should be moving from "we know cost per lead" to "we know cost per job." That single improvement can transform how you allocate budget.

## Setting Up Proper Tracking: The Developer Angle

This is where most guides get vague. I'm going to get specific because [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics) is foundational to everything else.

**GA4 Configuration for Service Businesses**

Standard GA4 setup is nearly useless for service businesses. It tracks pageviews. You need it to track business outcomes.

Here's what to configure:

Phone click tracking. Every click on a tel: link should fire an event. The code is straightforward:

Add an event listener to all phone links that sends a custom event to GA4 with parameters for the page URL, traffic source, and phone number clicked. Ten lines of JavaScript. But almost nobody does it.

Form submission tracking with source attribution. Don't just track "form submitted." Track the full context: which form, which page, what traffic source brought them there, what campaign if any.

Scroll depth events. Someone who reads 75% of your roofing page is a warmer prospect than someone who bounced after 3 seconds. Create threshold events at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.

Session duration by page type. How long do people spend on your service pages versus your blog? This tells you which content is actually engaging.

Enhanced conversions. If you're running Google Ads, enable enhanced conversions. This lets you pass hashed customer data back to Google for better attribution.

**Call Tracking Implementation**

This is non-negotiable for service businesses. You need to know which marketing generates which phone calls.

The setup: Use a call tracking service (CallRail, WhatConverts, CallTrackingMetrics). Create unique tracking numbers for each marketing channel.

Your Google Ads get one number. Your organic website traffic sees a dynamically inserted number based on their traffic source. Your Google Business Profile gets another number. Direct mail gets another.

Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) is the key feature. When someone lands on your website from a Google organic search, they see a different phone number than someone who came from Facebook. The call tracking system logs which source generated each call.

Integration with GA4: Your call tracking platform should push call data back to Google Analytics as events. Now you can see calls alongside your other conversion data in one place.

One technical note: Don't create dozens of static tracking numbers for different pages or campaigns. This creates NAP (Name, Address, Phone) inconsistency issues that hurt local SEO. Use DNI for your website and limit static tracking numbers to offline channels and third-party platforms.

**Form Tracking That Works**

Every form submission should capture:

- Which form (contact, quote request, service-specific)
- Which page the form was on
- Traffic source/medium/campaign
- Any hidden fields with UTM parameters
- Timestamp

Push all of this to GA4 and your CRM simultaneously. If your form only sends an email notification, you've already lost data.

**CRM Integration for Closed-Loop Reporting**

This is where [analytics tracking](/services/analytics) goes from good to transformational.

The goal: connect your marketing data to your closed jobs. When you sign a $15,000 contract, you should be able to trace it back to exactly which marketing brought that customer in.

The technical approach:

1. When a lead comes in (call or form), capture their marketing attribution data.
2. Create or update the contact in your CRM with that attribution data attached.
3. As the lead progresses through your pipeline (estimate scheduled, proposal sent, job won), that marketing attribution stays with them.
4. When the job closes, you can report revenue back to the marketing source.

For Google Ads, this means implementing offline conversion tracking. You pass the GCLID (Google Click ID) from the ad click through your entire funnel, then upload completed jobs with their GCLID back to Google Ads. Now Google knows which keywords and campaigns generate actual revenue, not just leads.

The CRMs that do this well: ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro have reasonable attribution features built in. Jobber is getting better. For custom integrations, Zapier or Make can connect most systems.

Is this setup work? Yes. Is it worth it? A client recently discovered their highest-volume lead source had the lowest close rate and smallest average job size. Their lowest-volume source had 3x the close rate and 2x the job size. Without closed-loop reporting, they would have doubled down on the wrong channel.

## Attribution Models for Service Businesses

Attribution is how you decide which marketing touchpoint gets credit for a conversion. For service businesses, this gets messy fast.

**First-Touch Attribution**

Credit goes to whatever marketing first brought the customer to you. They searched "roof repair austin," clicked your ad, and called three weeks later after visiting four more times? The first ad click gets 100% credit.

Pros: Simple. Good for understanding what drives awareness.

Cons: Ignores everything that happened between first touch and conversion. Overvalues top-of-funnel.

**Last-Touch Attribution**

Credit goes to the final interaction before conversion. They came from organic search, saw three retargeting ads, then called after clicking an email link? Email gets 100% credit.

Pros: Simple. Good for understanding what closes deals.

Cons: Ignores everything that built the relationship. Undervalues awareness and nurturing.

**Multi-Touch Attribution**

Credit is distributed across all touchpoints in the journey. Linear attribution splits credit equally. Time-decay gives more credit to touchpoints closer to conversion. Position-based (U-shaped) gives 40% to first touch, 40% to last touch, and 20% distributed across the middle.

Pros: More realistic view of the customer journey.

Cons: Harder to implement. Requires complete tracking across all touchpoints.

**Why Phone Calls Complicate Everything**

Here's the technical problem: phone calls break the digital trail.

Someone clicks your Google Ad, lands on your website, then picks up their phone and calls. Unless you have call tracking with proper attribution, you just lost the connection between that ad click and the call.

Even with call tracking, you might not match the call to the specific website session. The customer might call from a different phone than the one they browsed on. They might call days later.

This is why service business attribution will never be as clean as e-commerce. The best you can do is: implement call tracking, use dynamic number insertion, capture as much session data as possible, and accept that some attribution will be "best guess."

**Practical Attribution for Small Businesses**

If you're a local service business spending less than $10k/month on marketing, don't overthink attribution models.

Start here:

1. Track all leads by source (where did they say they heard about you? + call tracking data + form attribution data).
2. Track all closed jobs back to their original lead source.
3. Calculate cost per job by source.
4. Allocate budget toward sources with lowest cost per job and highest job value.

That's it. You don't need a sophisticated multi-touch model until you have the basics working.

## Building a Marketing Dashboard

Reports are useless if nobody looks at them. A dashboard that updates automatically and answers specific questions is worth a hundred PDFs.

**What to Include**

Lead volume by source. How many leads came from Google Ads, organic search, Google Business Profile, Facebook, referrals, etc.?

Lead quality by source. What percentage of leads from each source became estimates? What percentage became jobs?

Cost per lead by source. What are you paying for each lead from each channel?

Cost per job by source. The metric that matters most.

Revenue attribution. How much revenue did marketing generate?

Trend lines. Are things getting better or worse? Month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons.

**Tools That Work**

Google Looker Studio (free) connects directly to GA4, Google Ads, and Google Sheets. For most service businesses, this is enough.

Create a data pipeline: Your call tracking and CRM data exports to Google Sheets (via Zapier or native integrations). Looker Studio pulls from Sheets and GA4. You get a live dashboard.

Alternatively, Databox or AgencyAnalytics are solid paid options with more pre-built connectors.

**Update Frequency**

Real-time dashboards are overrated for most businesses. The data doesn't change that fast, and you don't have time to stare at screens all day.

Weekly updates work for most metrics. Monthly deep-dives for trend analysis and budget decisions. Quarterly reviews for strategic changes.

Set a calendar reminder to actually look at the dashboard. Data you never review is data you wasted time collecting.

## ROI Calculation Framework

Now for the actual math.

**The Basic Formula**

Marketing ROI = (Revenue Attributed to Marketing - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost x 100

If you spent $5,000 on marketing and generated $25,000 in revenue from marketing-attributed jobs:

ROI = ($25,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 x 100 = 400%

For every dollar spent, you got four dollars back. That's a healthy return.

**Accounting for Lag Time**

Here's where service businesses differ from e-commerce. Your ROI calculation needs to account for sales cycle length.

If your average time from first touch to closed job is 45 days, you can't judge January's marketing spend by January's revenue. You need to judge it by February and March's revenue.

Create cohort-based analysis. Take all leads from January. Track them for 90 days (or whatever your typical max sales cycle is). Calculate revenue generated by that cohort. Now you can accurately calculate January's marketing ROI.

**Seasonal Adjustments**

For HVAC, roofing, and other seasonal businesses, comparing raw month-to-month numbers is misleading.

Compare year-over-year instead. January 2026 vs. January 2025. This controls for seasonality.

If you want month-over-month insights, use seasonality indexes. If January typically represents 5% of annual revenue and July represents 15%, weight your expectations accordingly.

**The Blended vs. Channel-Specific View**

Calculate both.

Blended marketing ROI gives you the overall picture: is your total marketing spend generating profitable returns?

Channel-specific ROI tells you where to adjust: Google Ads might have 500% ROI while Facebook has 80%. Shift budget accordingly.

A warning: don't just chase the highest-ROI channel. Some channels have limited scale. Your LSAs might have 1000% ROI, but you can only get so many leads from them. The next-best channel might be necessary for growth even if its ROI is lower.

## Common Measurement Mistakes

I've audited hundreds of marketing setups. These are the mistakes I see repeatedly.

**Counting Leads, Not Jobs**

Your marketing generated 100 leads. Great. How many became jobs?

If Channel A generates 50 leads and 10 jobs, and Channel B generates 20 leads and 15 jobs, Channel B is better even though it generated fewer leads.

Leads are not the goal. Revenue is the goal. Optimize accordingly.

**Ignoring Customer Quality**

A lead for a $500 repair and a lead for a $20,000 system replacement are not the same. Your ROI calculations need to weight job value.

If all your Google Ads leads are small repairs and all your referral leads are major projects, raw cost-per-lead comparisons are meaningless.

Calculate revenue per lead by source. This accounts for quality differences.

**Short Measurement Windows**

You ran Google Ads for 60 days, got 15 leads, and declared it a failure.

But your average sales cycle is 45 days. Half those leads are still in the pipeline. You're evaluating an incomplete dataset.

Extend your measurement window to at least 1.5x your average sales cycle before making channel decisions.

**Not Accounting for Lifetime Value**

A new customer costs you $300 to acquire. Their first job nets you $200 profit. Bad ROI, right?

But that customer comes back for three more jobs over five years, totaling $2,000 in profit. Now that $300 acquisition cost looks brilliant.

For repeat-service businesses (HVAC maintenance, regular landscaping, property management), LTV changes everything about how you evaluate marketing.

**Attributing Poorly Tracked Leads to "Direct"**

If your tracking breaks at any point, the lead typically gets attributed to "direct" or "none." Over time, your "direct" traffic balloons.

If direct traffic is growing faster than your business, that's a data quality problem, not a marketing win. Audit your tracking.

## What to Do When You Can't Measure Perfectly

Perfect measurement is impossible. Customers use multiple devices. Some touchpoints happen offline. Some attribution will always be estimated.

Here's how to make good decisions with imperfect data.

**Directional Indicators**

You might not know the exact ROI of a channel, but you can identify directional trends.

Is cost per lead going up or down? Is lead volume from this source growing or shrinking? Are close rates from this source improving or declining?

Directional data is often enough for budget decisions. If every metric for a channel is trending in the wrong direction, cut the budget. If everything's improving, consider increasing it.

**A/B Testing for Clarity**

When you can't measure something directly, test it.

Pause a campaign for 30 days and see what happens to lead flow. Run a promo in only half your service area and compare results. Send one version of an email to half your list and another version to the other half.

Controlled experiments give you clearer signal than multi-variate mess.

**Customer Surveys**

Sometimes the simplest approach works: ask customers how they found you.

Add a required field to your intake form or phone script. Track the responses. Yes, customers sometimes get it wrong or simplify ("Google" when they actually saw a Google Ad). But aggregate data from customer surveys often reveals channel performance that digital tracking misses.

**Incrementality Testing**

The advanced version of A/B testing. You run a channel in some markets but not others (or run it at different spend levels), then compare results between the groups.

This isolates the true incremental impact of a channel. Did Google Ads actually generate more revenue, or did it just take credit for customers who would have found you anyway?

For larger budgets ($10k+/month per channel), incrementality testing should be part of your optimization strategy.

## The Bottom Line

Measuring marketing ROI for service businesses requires more work than the standard playbook allows.

You need tracking that captures phone calls, forms, and offline conversions. You need systems that connect marketing data to closed jobs. You need analytics configured for your actual business model. And you need to accept that some measurement will always be imperfect.

The alternative is flying blind. Making budget decisions based on which agency sends the nicest-looking report. Optimizing for leads when you should be optimizing for revenue. Cutting channels that work and doubling down on channels that don't.

The technical foundation matters. That's why [our approach to analytics](/services/analytics) starts with measurement architecture before we ever talk about campaigns.

Most marketing agencies don't want to do this work. It's harder than running ads and sending vanity metric reports. But it's the only way to actually know what's working.

    title: 'The Home Services Marketing Guide That Actually Works',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most marketing advice is written for tech startups and e-commerce. Here\'s what actually moves the needle for roofers, HVAC contractors, and home service businesses.',
    content: `
Everything you've read about marketing is probably wrong for your business.

I've spent years watching contractors burn through marketing budgets following advice meant for software companies. A roofing company isn't a SaaS startup. An HVAC contractor isn't selling shoes online. The playbook is different.

This guide is what I wish existed when I started working with home service businesses. No fluff. No "build your brand" nonsense. Just what actually generates jobs.

## Why Generic Marketing Advice Fails Home Services

Here's the fundamental problem: most marketing content is written by people who've never had to explain to a frustrated business owner why their $5,000 ad spend generated lots of "engagement" but zero phone calls.

Home services marketing has unique constraints that break standard advice:

**The lead-to-job gap is massive.** A software company counts a form submission as a conversion. You count a signed contract after an in-person estimate. That's two completely different games.

**Geography limits everything.** You can't scale by reaching more people. You scale by converting more of the people in your service area. A viral post doesn't help when your trucks only drive 30 miles.

**Seasonality hits hard.** HVAC companies live and die by weather. Roofers watch insurance adjusters like farmers watch rain. Your marketing can't pretend this doesn't exist.

**Trust is the product.** You're asking someone to let strangers into their home and write a check for $8,000. That requires a different kind of persuasion than selling a $50 product online.

The advice that follows accounts for all of this.

## The Foundation: Tracking That Actually Works

I'm putting this first because nothing else matters without it. I've audited hundreds of contractor marketing setups. Maybe 5% had tracking that could actually tell them which marketing generated which jobs.

Most have Google Analytics installed. Almost none have it configured to measure what matters.

**GA4 Setup That Works for Services**

Standard GA4 tracks page views. Useless. You need it tracking what matters for [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics):

Phone call clicks from your website. This requires setting up event tracking for tel: links. If your developer tells you this is hard, get a new developer. It's 10 lines of code.

Form submissions with source attribution. Not just "form submitted" but "form submitted by someone who found us through Google organic search for 'roof repair austin'."

Scroll depth on service pages. If someone reads 75% of your roofing page, they're a warmer lead than someone who bounced after 3 seconds. Treat them differently.

Here's the GA4 event setup you actually need:

Create custom events for: phone_click, form_submit, chat_initiated, and quote_request. Tag each with the traffic source, landing page, and service category. This takes about two hours to set up properly. Those two hours will save you from making $50,000 in bad marketing decisions.

**Call Tracking Implementation**

This is where most contractors lose the plot entirely.

You need a call tracking system. CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, WhatConverts—pick one. They all work. The point is getting a unique phone number for each marketing channel so you know what's generating calls.

The setup: Your Google Ads get one tracking number. Your organic search traffic sees a different number on your website (dynamic number insertion). Your Google Business Profile gets another. Your Facebook ads get another.

Now when someone calls, you know exactly which marketing brought them in. Revolutionary, right? Yet 90% of contractors I talk to have no idea which of their marketing channels actually generate phone calls. They're just guessing.

One warning: don't use too many tracking numbers or you'll dilute your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency for local SEO. Use dynamic number insertion on your website instead of hard-coding multiple numbers.

**Attribution That Connects to Closed Jobs**

Here's where [proper attribution](/services/analytics) gets into territory most marketing guides won't touch because it requires actual work.

Your marketing attribution is worthless if it stops at "lead generated." The lead that turned into a $15,000 job matters more than the ten leads that ghosted you.

The fix: your CRM needs to talk to your marketing data.

This means either using a CRM that integrates with your call tracking and analytics (Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan, Jobber all have varying levels of this), or building the connection yourself. We've built custom integrations using Zapier and webhooks that push closed job data back to Google Analytics and ad platforms.

When you close a job, you should be able to trace it back to: which keyword they searched, which ad they clicked, which page they landed on, and which phone number they called. This is table stakes for making smart budget decisions.

Without this, you're optimizing for leads. With it, you're optimizing for revenue.

## Local SEO: The 80/20 That Moves the Needle

I could write 50,000 words on [local SEO](/services/seo). But you don't need 50,000 words. You need to know what actually matters and what's a waste of time.

**Google Business Profile Optimization**

Your Google Business Profile is probably your single most important marketing asset. Not your website. Not your ads. The thing that shows up when someone searches "roofer near me."

Here's what actually moves rankings:

Primary category matters most. Pick the most specific category that matches your primary service. "Roofing Contractor" beats "Contractor." "HVAC Contractor" beats "Home Services."

Complete every field. Hours, services, service area, attributes—all of it. Google rewards completeness. This takes 30 minutes and most competitors skip it.

Photos that aren't stock images. Real job photos, team photos, truck photos. Before and afters of actual work you did. Google can tell the difference between stock photos and real ones. So can customers.

Posts every week. Not because anyone reads them—they don't. Because consistent posting signals to Google that your business is active. We've tested this extensively. Profiles that post weekly rank better than identical profiles that don't.

Q&A optimization. Add your own questions and answers with keywords in them. "Do you offer emergency roof repair?" "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout Austin and surrounding areas." It's free keyword optimization most competitors ignore.

**Reviews: Strategy Without Sleaze**

More reviews generally means better rankings and more conversions. But the "how" matters.

Never offer incentives for reviews. It's against Google's terms, it's transparent to customers, and it undermines trust. One negative "this company paid me to write this" review can tank your conversion rate.

Instead: make leaving a review stupidly easy.

Send a text with a direct link to your Google review page immediately after job completion, while they're still feeling good about the work. Not an email buried in their inbox. A text. The tap-to-review rate on texts is 10x higher than email.

The script that works: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review helps other homeowners find us: [link]" That's it. No begging. No "it would really mean a lot." Just the ask and the link.

Respond to every review. Positive: quick thanks. Negative: professional response that acknowledges the issue and offers resolution. Future customers read your responses more carefully than the reviews themselves.

**Citations That Matter vs. Waste of Time**

"Citation building" used to be a thing. Agencies would charge thousands to get you listed on 200 directories nobody's ever heard of.

Most of that is worthless now. Here's what actually matters:

The big four: Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Facebook. Get these right first.

Industry-specific directories: Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Houzz, and industry-specific directories for your trade. These actually send traffic.

Local directories: Your local Chamber of Commerce, BBB if you're a member, local business associations.

That's roughly 15-20 citations that actually matter. Beyond that, you're chasing diminishing returns. Don't let an agency convince you that your 47th directory listing is moving the needle.

The key across all citations: NAP consistency. Your name, address, and phone number should be identical everywhere. Not similar. Identical. "123 Main Street" and "123 Main St." are not the same to Google.

## Paid Advertising: Where to Actually Spend

Everyone wants to know: Google Ads or Facebook? LSAs or display? Here's the honest breakdown based on spending millions of dollars across home service clients.

:::pullquote
"Local Service Ads have the highest intent of any paid channel. When someone searches 'emergency plumber' and calls from an LSA, they need help now." - Max out LSAs before exploring other channels.
:::

**Google Ads vs. LSAs vs. Facebook**

Understanding the differences between [paid advertising channels](/services/paid-advertising) is critical. Local Service Ads (LSAs) have the highest intent. When someone searches "emergency plumber" and calls directly from the LSA, they need a plumber right now. LSAs work on a pay-per-lead model, so you only pay when someone actually contacts you.

The catch: LSAs have limited inventory. You can't just spend more to get more leads. Google shows them based on proximity, reviews, and responsiveness. Max out LSAs first, then look elsewhere.

Google Search Ads capture high-intent searches that LSAs don't cover. Someone searching "best roofing company austin" or "hvac installation cost" is actively shopping. These leads are more expensive but convert well.

The key with Search Ads: ruthless negative keyword management. You'll blow through budget fast on worthless searches like "roofing jobs" (people looking for employment) or "diy roof repair" if you don't actively exclude them.

Start with exact match and phrase match keywords only. Broad match is a budget incinerator for home services. Google will gleefully spend your money on tangentially related searches.

[Facebook and Instagram ads](/services/paid-advertising) work differently. Lower intent, lower cost per click, higher volume. Nobody's on Facebook looking for a roofer. But you can reach people who might need one.

Facebook works best for: high-value services with longer consideration cycles (new HVAC systems, bathroom remodels), brand building in your service area, and retargeting people who visited your website but didn't convert.

Facebook doesn't work for: emergency services, low-ticket repairs, time-sensitive needs.

**Budget Allocation by Business Stage**

If you're spending under $3,000/month total on advertising:

Put 100% into LSAs until you've maxed them out, then move to Google Search. Don't split your budget across platforms. Concentration beats diversification when you're small.

If you're spending $3,000-10,000/month:

60% Google (LSAs + Search), 30% Facebook/Instagram for retargeting and high-value services, 10% testing new channels.

If you're spending $10,000+/month:

Now you can test properly. 50% to proven channels, 25% to expansion, 25% to experiments. At this budget, you should be running incrementality tests to verify each channel's true contribution.

**The Metrics That Matter**

Stop looking at:
- Cost per click
- Click-through rate
- Impressions
- Reach

Start looking at:
- Cost per qualified lead (someone who actually wants your service in your area)
- Cost per estimate (leads that became appointments)
- Cost per job (the actual metric that matters)
- Return on ad spend (revenue generated divided by ad cost)

:::tip
A campaign with $50 cost per click that generates $12,000 jobs beats a campaign with $5 cost per click that generates tire-kickers every time. Stop optimizing for cheap clicks—optimize for profitable jobs.
:::

## Content & Website Optimization

Your website exists to convert visitors into leads. That's it. Everything else is secondary. This is where [conversion rate optimization](/services/cro) becomes essential.

**Pages That Convert for Service Businesses**

You need these pages, optimized for both search and conversion:

Homepage: Clear value proposition, primary service areas, trust signals (reviews, certifications, years in business), and obvious contact options. Don't bury the phone number.

Individual service pages: One page per major service. Not a generic "services" page. "Roof Replacement" gets its own page. "Roof Repair" gets its own page. "Storm Damage Repair" gets its own page. Each page targets specific keywords and addresses specific concerns.

Location pages: If you serve multiple cities, each city gets a page. "Roofing Contractor in Round Rock" is a different page than "Roofing Contractor in Cedar Park." Yes, it's more work. Yes, it matters.

About/Team page: Real photos of real people. Bios that establish credibility. This is where you build the trust that converts browsers into callers.

Reviews/testimonials page: Aggregated proof that you do good work. Embed your Google reviews, add photos of completed projects, include video testimonials if you have them.

**The One Thing Most Contractor Websites Get Wrong**

Buried contact information.

I've seen contractor websites where you have to scroll through three screens of content to find a phone number. I've seen sites where "Contact Us" is a tiny link in the footer. I've seen sites where the only way to reach the company is through a contact form hidden on a separate page.

Your phone number should be visible without scrolling on every page. Click-to-call on mobile. Sticky header with contact info that follows the user.

People searching for home services often have urgent needs. Make it stupidly easy to call you. If someone lands on your site and can't immediately figure out how to contact you, they're gone.

:::stat 70%+
of local searches happen on phones. If your site is slow or clunky on mobile, you're hemorrhaging leads. Mobile experience matters more than desktop.
:::

## Marketing Automation Without Enterprise Tools

ServiceTitan costs $500+/month. HubSpot enterprise is thousands. You don't need either to automate your marketing.

**Practical Workflows Using Accessible Tools**

The goal is simple: no lead should fall through the cracks because someone forgot to follow up.

Stack we recommend for sub-$200/month:

CRM: Housecall Pro or Jobber ($50-100/month). Both handle scheduling, invoicing, and basic automation.

Email automation: Mailchimp or MailerLite free tiers get you started. ConvertKit if you need more sophistication.

Text automation: TextMagic or SimpleTexting ($25-50/month). Critical for lead response speed.

Integration glue: Zapier ($20-50/month). Connects everything.

**Lead Follow-Up Sequences That Work**

When a lead comes in—whether from a form, call, or chat—this sequence should fire automatically:

0-5 minutes: Automated text confirming receipt. "Thanks for reaching out about [service]. Someone from our team will contact you within the hour."

:::stat 70%+
The contractor who calls first gets the job. Speed-to-lead is everything.
:::

5-15 minutes: Phone call from your team.

Same day: If no answer, follow-up text. "Hi [Name], tried calling about your [service] request. When's a good time to reach you?"

Day 2: Another call attempt + email with helpful information about the service they requested.

Day 4: "Checking in" text. Low pressure.

Day 7: Final "want us to close your request?" message.

This entire sequence can be automated with the tools above. Your job is just making the phone calls. Everything else runs itself.

The mistake I see: contractors who respond to leads within 2-3 days. By then, the customer has already scheduled with two other companies. Speed is your competitive advantage.

## Measuring What Matters

At this point, you're tracking properly, generating leads from multiple channels, and following up automatically. Now you need to make sense of it all.

**ROI Calculation Framework**

Monthly marketing ROI shouldn't be complicated. Here's the spreadsheet you need:

For each marketing channel, track:
- Total spend (ads + tools + agency fees)
- Leads generated
- Estimates scheduled
- Jobs closed
- Revenue from those jobs

Then calculate:
- Cost per lead (spend / leads)
- Cost per estimate (spend / estimates)
- Cost per job (spend / jobs)
- Return on investment ((revenue - spend) / spend)

A channel with 5x ROI (you spend $1,000, you get $5,000 in revenue) is printing money. A channel with 1.5x ROI barely covers your overhead. A channel below 1x ROI is losing money.

Most contractors can't produce these numbers. Which means they can't make informed decisions about where to spend more or less.

**Dashboard Setup**

You don't need a fancy BI tool. You need a spreadsheet that answers three questions:

1. Where did our leads come from this month?
2. What did each lead cost us?
3. Which channels are generating profitable jobs?

Update it weekly. Review it monthly. Adjust spend quarterly.

We build these dashboards in Google Sheets connected to call tracking and CRM data via Zapier. Takes about 4 hours to set up, saves thousands in wasted spend.

## The 12-Month Marketing Plan

If you're starting from scratch or rebuilding a failed marketing effort, here's how to phase it.

**Months 1-3: Foundation**

Fix your tracking. This is not optional. You cannot optimize what you cannot measure. GA4 properly configured. Call tracking installed. CRM integrated.

Optimize your Google Business Profile completely. Every field, weekly posts, photo uploads.

Launch LSAs if you haven't. Get through Google's verification process and start generating high-intent leads.

Build or fix your core website pages. Homepage, service pages, contact page. Mobile-optimized, fast-loading, clear CTAs.

Set up basic automation. Lead response texts at minimum.

**Months 4-6: Expansion**

Layer in Google Search Ads. Start conservative with exact match keywords. Monitor search terms report weekly to add negatives.

Begin review generation system. Text follow-ups after every job.

Create remaining service and location pages. Expand your SEO footprint.

Test Facebook retargeting. Small budget, focused on people who visited your site but didn't convert.

**Months 7-12: Optimization**

Now you have data. Use it.

Double down on channels with highest ROI. Cut or reduce channels underperforming.

[A/B test landing pages](/services/cro). Try different headlines, different CTAs, different layouts.

Expand geographic targeting if demand supports it.

Add seasonal campaigns for predictable spikes (spring for roofing, fall for HVAC).

Build out [content for longer-tail keywords](/services/content). "How to know if you need a new roof" type guides that capture early-stage research.

## What Happens Next

This guide is around 4,000 words. The implementation is hundreds of hours. Most contractors won't do it. They'll hire an agency that shows them pretty reports full of impressions, or they'll try one thing for two months, not see results, and quit.

The contractors who dominate their local markets do this work. They track everything. They follow up fast. They optimize ruthlessly. It's not complicated, but it is hard.

If you want help implementing this—actually building the tracking, setting up the automation, running the ads—that's what we do. We've built these systems for dozens of home service companies. We'll build you a dashboard where you can see exactly which marketing generates which jobs. No vanity metrics. No mystery.

    excerpt: 'That $3,000/month report full of "impressions" and "reach"? It might be hiding the fact that you\'re getting nothing in return.',
    content: `
Last month, a contractor I know showed me his marketing report. He'd been paying $3,000 a month for "digital marketing services" for eight months. That's $24,000.

I asked him a simple question: "How many leads did this generate?"

He didn't know. The reports talked about impressions, reach, engagement rates. Lots of colorful graphs. Not a single mention of phone calls, form submissions, or actual customers. When he asked his agency directly, they sent him a longer PDF. Still no answer.

This isn't an isolated case. It's the damn industry standard.

## Red Flag #1: Vanity Metrics

Here's what a typical agency report looks like:

- 50,000 impressions
- 12,000 reach
- 3.2% engagement rate
- "Strong brand visibility"

Here's what that same report should say:

- 50,000 impressions
- 0 phone calls
- 0 form submissions
- **$0 in value**

"Impressions" means your ad loaded on someone's screen. They probably didn't see it. They definitely didn't care. Engagement rate? Someone scrolled past your post slightly slower than the others.

None of this matters if it doesn't turn into business. A report without lead counts, cost per lead, and conversion rates is a report designed to hide failure. If your agency can't tell you how many customers they brought in last month, they're either incompetent or hoping you won't ask.

## Red Flag #2: The "Brand Building" Excuse

When you press an agency for real numbers, they'll often retreat to "brand awareness."

"We're building your brand. You can't measure that directly. It takes time to see results."

This is cover for having nothing to show. Real brand building has milestones. After 3 months, direct search traffic should increase. After 6 months, you should see branded keyword growth. These are measurable.

If your agency talks about brand awareness without specific timelines and metrics, they're hoping you'll keep paying while they figure out what they're doing. Real agencies set expectations: "By month three, we expect X. If we don't hit it, here's what we'll change."

## Red Flag #3: Data Hostages

Ask your agency for login access to your Google Analytics. Your Google Ads account. Your Facebook Business Manager.

If they hesitate, that's a problem. If they say "we manage that for you," that's a bigger problem.

**You should own everything.** Your analytics, your ad accounts, your domain, your hosting. All of it. An agency that sets up accounts in their name is holding your data hostage. When you leave, you lose your history, your audiences, your everything.

We set up every account in our clients' names on day one. Full admin access. If you fire us tomorrow, you walk away with everything we built. That's how it should work.

## Red Flag #4: The Escape Tax

Watch out for:

- "Setup fees" that mysteriously equal one month's payment
- "Ramp-up periods" where results don't count
- 6-12 month contracts with early termination penalties
- Vague language about "campaign momentum" if you consider leaving

These are designed to trap you. If an agency is confident in their work, they don't need to lock you in. Good results keep clients around. Contracts keep hostages around.

We work month-to-month. No setup fees. No termination penalties. Every month, we have to earn your business again. That's how it should be.

## What to Demand Instead

Before signing with any agency—including us—ask these five questions:

**1. "Can I see my Google Analytics in real time?"**
You should have your own login. If they won't give it to you, walk away.

**2. "How many leads or calls did we get last month?"**
An actual number. Not impressions. Not reach. Leads.

**3. "What's my cost per lead?"**
Total spend divided by total leads. If they can't answer this, they're not tracking properly.

**4. "Do I own all my accounts and data?"**
Google Ads, Facebook, Analytics, Search Console—all should be in your name.

**5. "What happens if I cancel next month?"**
The answer should be: "You keep everything, we part ways." Anything else is a red flag.

## Why We Built BKND This Way

I'm a developer by trade. Spent years building software where everything is measured, tested, and accountable. Every feature either works or it doesn't. You can't hide behind "brand awareness" when the code doesn't compile.

I got tired of watching businesses waste money on marketing that couldn't prove its value. So I built an agency that treats clients like adults. We show you the real numbers. We give you full ownership. We earn your business every single month.

If that sounds refreshing, we should talk. If you like the mystery, there are plenty of other agencies happy to take your $3,000.

    title: 'The Real Cost of Vanity Metrics',
    date: '2026-01-15',
    excerpt: 'Impressions and engagement rates feel good to report, but they can hide the truth about whether your marketing is actually working.',
    content: `
Your marketing report lands in your inbox. Impressions are up 200%. Engagement rate hit an all-time high. Social followers grew by 15%.

Everything looks great. Except revenue is flat.

## What Are Vanity Metrics?

Vanity metrics are numbers that look impressive but don't correlate with business outcomes. They're easy to grow, easy to report, and completely useless for making decisions.

Common vanity metrics include:

- **Impressions**: How many times your ad was displayed (not how many people actually noticed it)
- **Follower counts**: How many people clicked follow (not how many care about what you post)
- **Page views**: How many times a page loaded (not how many people read the content)

## The Opportunity Cost

Every hour spent optimizing for vanity metrics is an hour not spent on what matters. While your team celebrates a viral post that generated zero leads, your competitor is running A/B tests on landing pages that convert.

## What to Measure Instead

Focus on metrics that connect to revenue:

**Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**: How much does it cost to acquire a customer?

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: How much revenue does a customer generate over time?

**Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: For every dollar spent on advertising, how much revenue comes back?

**Pipeline Velocity**: How quickly are leads moving through your funnel?

These metrics might not look as impressive in a slide deck, but they'll tell you whether your marketing is actually working.

## Making the Shift

The transition from vanity metrics to meaningful metrics isn't easy. It requires better tracking, clearer attribution, and often uncomfortable conversations about what's really driving growth.

But once you make the shift, you'll wonder how you ever operated any other way.

    title: 'Attribution Is Harder Than You Think',
    date: '2026-01-10',
    excerpt: 'Understanding which marketing channels actually drive revenue requires more than just looking at last-click data.',
    content: `
A customer finds you through a Google ad, reads three blog posts over two weeks, clicks a retargeting ad on LinkedIn, and finally converts after receiving an email.

Which channel gets credit for the sale?

## The Last-Click Fallacy

Most businesses default to last-click attribution. Whatever touchpoint happened right before conversion gets 100% of the credit. It's simple, but it's wrong.

In our example, the email would get all the credit. But would that customer have converted without the initial Google ad that introduced them to your brand? Without the blog content that built trust? Without the retargeting that kept you top of mind?

## Why Attribution Matters

If you're making budget decisions based on bad attribution data, you're probably:

- Over-investing in bottom-of-funnel channels
- Under-investing in awareness and consideration
- Missing the full picture of your customer journey

## Better Approaches

**Multi-Touch Attribution**: Distribute credit across all touchpoints based on their role in the journey. First touch introduced the prospect. Middle touches nurtured them. Last touch closed the deal.

**Incrementality Testing**: Run controlled experiments to measure the true impact of each channel. What happens to revenue when you turn off a specific ad campaign?

**Marketing Mix Modeling**: Use statistical analysis to understand how different channels contribute to overall performance, accounting for factors like seasonality and market conditions.

## The Honest Truth

Perfect attribution is impossible. Customer journeys are messy. Some touchpoints happen offline. Some influence can't be tracked.

But imperfect attribution based on solid methodology is infinitely better than last-click guessing. The goal isn't perfect data—it's better decisions.

    title: 'Building a Marketing Dashboard for Service Companies',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Stop guessing which marketing channels work. Build a dashboard that shows exactly where your leads come from, what they cost, and which ones turn into paying jobs.',
    content: `
Most service company owners I talk to have the same problem. They spend money on marketing. Some leads come in. They close some jobs. But they have no idea which marketing actually works.

They might have a "gut feeling" that Google Ads brings in good leads. Or that the SEO they're paying for is "probably working." But when I ask them to show me the data, they open six different tabs and start copying numbers into a spreadsheet.

That's not a marketing system. That's guessing with extra steps.

A proper marketing dashboard changes everything. You open one screen and see exactly what's happening. Where leads come from. What they cost. Which ones convert to paying customers. You make decisions based on data instead of hunches.

This guide shows you how to build one.

## Why You Need a Dashboard (Not Just Reports)

Reports tell you what happened. Dashboards show you what's happening right now and what to do about it.

The difference matters for service companies because your marketing spend decisions happen constantly. Should you increase Google Ads budget this week? Is that new landing page converting? Did the radio ad actually generate calls?

With a report, you wait until month-end. Pull data manually. Hope nothing got missed. By the time you see the numbers, you've already wasted two more weeks of budget on something that wasn't working.

With a dashboard, you see changes in real-time. Or close to it. A campaign tanks on Tuesday, you catch it Wednesday morning instead of three weeks later.

[Proper analytics setup](/services/analytics) is the foundation. Without clean data flowing into your dashboard, you're just visualizing garbage.

## Metrics That Actually Matter

Every dashboard article lists the same generic metrics. Impressions. Clicks. CTR. Bounce rate.

Those metrics are fine for agencies writing monthly reports. They're useless for making business decisions.

Here's what service company owners actually need to track.

### Traffic Metrics (The Foundation)

**Sessions by source.** Not just total sessions. Break it down by channel: organic search, paid search, social, direct, referral. You need to know where people come from before you can evaluate anything else.

**New vs returning users.** Service companies live on new customers. If 80% of your traffic is returning visitors, your marketing isn't expanding your reach. It's just circulating the same audience.

**Geographic distribution.** If you're a Phoenix HVAC company and half your traffic comes from Chicago, something's wrong. Usually poorly targeted ads or content ranking for the wrong locations.

### Lead Metrics (The Money)

**Form submissions by source.** Every form fill should be attributed to its traffic source. Did this lead come from Google Ads? Organic search? A referral? This is table stakes.

**Phone calls by source.** This requires call tracking, which I'll cover later. If you're not tracking calls, you're missing 40-60% of your leads depending on your industry.

**Chat conversations by source.** If you use live chat or chatbots, same deal. Track where those conversations originate.

**Cost per lead by channel.** Total spend divided by total leads per channel. Simple math, but most companies can't actually calculate this because their data is fragmented.

### Conversion Metrics (The Truth)

**Lead to quote rate.** What percentage of leads actually get a quote? If you're generating 100 leads but only quoting 20, either your lead quality is terrible or your sales process has problems.

**Quote to job rate.** Of the quotes you send, how many become paying customers? This measures both lead quality and sales effectiveness.

**Lead to job rate.** The whole funnel in one number. If 3% of your leads become customers, you need 33 leads to get one job. Now you can calculate how many leads you need to hit revenue targets.

### Revenue Metrics (The Business)

**Cost per acquisition by channel.** Not cost per lead. Cost per paying customer. If Google Ads generates $50 leads but only 2% convert, your cost per customer is $2,500. If SEO generates $100 leads that convert at 8%, cost per customer is $1,250. The "expensive" leads might actually be cheaper.

**Customer lifetime value by source.** Some channels attract one-time customers. Others attract people who become repeat clients. Track average customer value by acquisition source to find your best channels.

**Return on ad spend (ROAS).** Revenue generated divided by advertising spend. A 4:1 ROAS means you made $4 for every $1 spent on ads. Anything below 3:1 is usually concerning for service companies.

This is where [measuring marketing ROI properly](/blog/marketing-roi-measurement) becomes critical. Vanity metrics feel good. Revenue metrics pay bills.

## Tool Options: Picking Your Platform

You have several options for building a marketing dashboard. Each has tradeoffs.

### Google Looker Studio (Free)

Formerly Google Data Studio. Free. Connects natively to Google products. Good enough for most service companies.

Pros: No cost. Direct Google Analytics and Google Ads integration. Flexible visualization. Easy sharing.

Cons: Learning curve. Can get slow with lots of data. Non-Google data requires connectors.

Best for: Companies primarily using Google Ads and wanting to keep costs down.

### Databox

Paid tool focused on simplicity. Pre-built templates. Good for non-technical users.

Pros: Beautiful templates. Easy setup. Mobile app.

Cons: Monthly cost ($72-200+/month). Less flexibility. Can get expensive as data sources grow.

Best for: Owners who want dashboards without touching data configuration.

### Agency Analytics

Built for marketing agencies but works for in-house teams too.

Pros: All-in-one platform. White-label options. Built-in reporting.

Cons: Cost ($79-179+/month). Overkill if you're not running client campaigns.

Best for: Companies managing marketing for multiple locations or brands.

### Custom Solutions

Build your own using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom code.

Pros: Complete flexibility. No vendor limitations. Can integrate any data source.

Cons: Expensive development. Ongoing maintenance. Requires technical resources.

Best for: Large companies with in-house data teams and complex requirements.

For most service companies, Looker Studio is the right choice. It's free, powerful enough, and integrates with the tools you're probably already using.

## Building Your Dashboard in Looker Studio

Enough theory. Let's build something.

### Step 1: Connect Google Analytics 4

Open [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com). Click "Create" then "Data source."

Search for "Google Analytics" and select the GA4 connector. Choose your property and click "Connect."

You'll see a list of all available metrics and dimensions. Don't worry about configuring anything here. Click "Create Report."

If you haven't set up GA4 properly yet, [this guide on GA4 setup for service businesses](/blog/ga4-setup-home-services) covers the essentials.

### Step 2: Connect Google Ads

In your report, click "Add data" in the toolbar. Search for "Google Ads" and connect your account.

Now you have both analytics and advertising data in the same report. This is where dashboards get powerful.

### Step 3: Connect Call Tracking

This is where most dashboards fall apart. Calls are critical for service companies, but tracking them requires additional setup.

If you use CallRail, search for their Looker Studio connector. Same process: connect, authenticate, add to report.

If you use a different call tracking provider, check if they have a Looker Studio connector. Most major ones do. If yours doesn't, you'll need to export data to Google Sheets and connect that instead.

No call tracking at all? That's a problem. You're flying blind on 40-60% of your leads. Consider implementing call tracking before building your dashboard.

### Step 4: Connect CRM Data

This is optional but valuable. If you can connect your CRM (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, etc.), you can track all the way from click to closed job.

Most CRMs don't have native Looker Studio connectors. You have options:

**Google Sheets bridge.** Export CRM data to Google Sheets (manually or via automation). Connect Sheets to Looker Studio. This works but requires maintenance.

**Third-party connectors.** Services like Supermetrics or Funnel can pull CRM data into Looker Studio. They cost money but save time.

**Zapier/Make automation.** Set up automated workflows to push CRM data to Google Sheets, which then feeds Looker Studio. More technical but more automated.

For most service companies, starting without CRM integration is fine. Add it later once you've proven the dashboard's value.

## Essential Dashboard Views

One dashboard trying to show everything shows nothing well. Build multiple views for different purposes.

### Executive Summary (One Page)

This is what the owner looks at. One page. Five to seven key metrics. Trends over time.

Include:
- Total leads this month vs last month
- Cost per lead
- Lead to job conversion rate
- Marketing spend vs revenue generated
- Top performing channel

Use scorecards for the metrics. A line chart for trend over time. That's it. No clutter.

### Channel Performance View

Deeper dive into each marketing channel. Compare Google Ads vs SEO vs referrals vs everything else.

Build a table showing each channel with: sessions, leads, cost, cost per lead, conversions, cost per conversion.

Add a pie chart showing lead distribution by channel. Add a bar chart comparing cost per acquisition across channels.

This view answers "where should I spend more?"

### Lead Source Breakdown

Even deeper. Within each channel, what's working?

For Google Ads: which campaigns generate leads? Which keywords? Which ad groups?

For SEO: which pages generate leads? Which locations? Which service types?

This view answers "what specifically should I optimize?"

### Trend Analysis View

Historical data. Week over week. Month over month. Year over year if you have the data.

Look for patterns. Seasonality. The impact of campaign changes. Long-term trends.

This view answers "is our marketing improving over time?"

## Visualization Best Practices

Bad visualization kills good data. Here's how to not screw it up.

### Scorecards for KPIs

Single metrics belong in scorecards. Large number. Comparison to previous period. Simple.

Don't put a single KPI in a pie chart. Don't use a bar chart for one number. Scorecards exist for this exact purpose.

### Time Series for Trends

Anything that changes over time goes in a line chart. Sessions over time. Leads over time. Cost per lead over time.

Use consistent time intervals. Don't mix daily with monthly on the same chart.

### Tables for Detail

When you need to show multiple metrics across multiple dimensions, tables work best. Campaigns by cost, clicks, conversions, and cost per conversion? Table.

Make tables sortable. Add conditional formatting to highlight good (green) and bad (red) performance.

### Comparison Periods

Every metric should have context. Is 100 leads good? Depends on whether last month was 50 or 200.

Add comparison periods to scorecards. Show previous period, previous year, or both. Without context, numbers mean nothing.

## Automation: Set It and (Mostly) Forget It

A dashboard you have to manually update isn't a dashboard. It's a report with a fancy name.

### Scheduled Email Reports

Looker Studio can email PDF reports on a schedule. Weekly summary every Monday. Monthly deep-dive on the 1st.

Set it up once. Forget about it. The data comes to you.

Navigate to "Schedule email delivery" in the file menu. Set recipients, frequency, and time.

### Alert Thresholds

This requires additional tooling, but it's worth it. Set alerts for metrics that drop below acceptable levels.

Google Ads has built-in alerts. Set one for when cost per conversion exceeds your target. Same for budget pacing, impression share drops, etc.

For more complex alerts, Google Analytics 4 has custom insights that can trigger email notifications when metrics change significantly.

### Auto-Refresh Settings

Looker Studio dashboards refresh when opened by default. You can also configure data freshness settings for each data source.

For most service companies, daily refresh is fine. Real-time data sounds nice but rarely changes decisions that quickly.

## Client Reporting vs Internal Dashboards

If you're working with a marketing agency, you'll get their reports. But those reports serve their interests, not just yours.

### What Clients (You) Need to See

- Actual business results: leads, customers, revenue
- Clear cost attribution: what did I pay, what did I get
- Trend direction: are things improving or declining
- Actionable insights: what should change

### What Agencies Want to Show

- Activity metrics: lots of work being done
- Vanity metrics: impressions, clicks, reach
- Positive spin: "CTR improved 15%!" (but conversions dropped)

A good agency provides both. But having your own dashboard means you can verify their reports and ask better questions.

The [home services marketing guide](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) covers more about evaluating marketing performance across channels.

## Common Dashboard Mistakes

I've seen hundreds of marketing dashboards. Most fail for the same reasons.

### Too Many Metrics

The instinct is to track everything. Resist it. A dashboard with 50 metrics is unusable. Nobody scrolls. Nobody analyzes.

Pick the 10-15 metrics that actually drive decisions. Cut everything else. You can always add more later if you genuinely need them.

### No Context or Benchmarks

"We got 47 leads this month." Great. Is that good? Bad? Normal?

Without context, data is just numbers. Add comparison periods. Set targets. Show benchmarks. Turn data into information.

### Vanity Metrics Focus

Impressions feel good. "We got 100,000 impressions!" Cool. How many became customers?

Every metric on your dashboard should connect to business outcomes. If you can't explain how a metric relates to revenue, cut it.

### Ignoring Data Quality

A beautiful dashboard built on bad data produces beautiful lies.

Before worrying about visualization, verify your data. Is tracking installed correctly? Are conversions being recorded? Is attribution working?

One broken pixel can make your entire dashboard worthless.

### Set-and-Forget Mentality

Dashboards need maintenance. Data sources change. Business priorities shift. New channels emerge.

Schedule quarterly reviews of your dashboard. Is it still measuring what matters? Are the data connections still working? Do the targets still make sense?

## Getting Started

Don't try to build everything at once. Start small. Prove value. Expand.

**Week 1:** Connect Google Analytics and Google Ads. Build a simple executive summary with five core metrics.

**Week 2:** Add call tracking integration. Refine visualizations based on what you actually look at.

**Week 3:** Build a channel performance view. Start comparing marketing investments.

**Week 4:** Review what's working. Cut what's not. Plan expansions.

The goal isn't a perfect dashboard. The goal is better decisions than you're making today.

A basic dashboard you actually use beats a sophisticated dashboard that sits untouched.

    title: 'Home Services Website Design: Conversion-Focused Best Practices',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most contractor websites look fine but fail at their one job: generating phone calls. Here are the technical specifics that actually convert visitors into customers.',
    content: `
Your website has one job. Get the phone to ring.

Not "build brand awareness." Not "establish thought leadership." Get homeowners to pick up the phone or fill out a form. Everything else is decoration.

I've audited hundreds of contractor websites. Most look decent. Most also convert at 1-2% when they should be hitting 5-8%. The difference between a 2% conversion rate and a 6% conversion rate on 1,000 monthly visitors is 40 extra leads per month. Same traffic, same ad spend, triple the results.

Here's what separates websites that generate leads from websites that generate compliments from your nephew who "knows computers."

## Why Most Contractor Websites Fail

Three problems kill most contractor websites. They're so common that I can predict them before seeing the site.

**The phone number is buried.**

I've seen roofing websites where you have to scroll past a hero image, company history, and three service descriptions before finding a phone number. On mobile, that's four thumb swipes before someone can call you.

When a homeowner's AC dies at 2pm in August, they're not reading your "Our Story" page. They're looking for a number to call. If they can't find it in 3 seconds, they hit the back button.

**The site loads like it's 2003.**

Google's data shows 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. Most contractor websites load in 6-8 seconds because they're running on cheap hosting with unoptimized images and bloated page builders.

Every second of load time costs you leads. Not metaphorically. Literally.

**No proof that you're legitimate.**

Stock photos of smiling contractors with perfectly clean uniforms. Generic testimonials that could apply to any business. No photos of actual jobs. No real customer names (even first names). No licensing information.

Homeowners are about to let a stranger into their house to do work they can't evaluate themselves. They're looking for reasons to trust you. Most contractor websites give them nothing to work with.

## Essential Pages for Home Services Websites

Skip the corporate bloat. You need five core pages that work, not fifteen pages that exist for the sake of having content.

### Homepage Structure

Your homepage is a sorting mechanism. Visitors should immediately understand what you do, where you do it, and how to contact you.

**Above the fold (no scrolling required):**

- Clear headline stating what you do and where. "24/7 Emergency Plumbing in Austin" beats "Welcome to Our Website."
- Phone number. Large. Click-to-call on mobile.
- One primary call-to-action button. "Get a Free Quote" or "Schedule Service."
- Trust indicators: years in business, number of jobs completed, average review rating.

**Below the fold:**

- Services overview with links to dedicated service pages.
- Social proof: reviews, testimonials, logos of review platforms.
- Service area map or list of cities served.
- Secondary CTA to capture visitors who aren't ready to call.

The homepage shouldn't try to do everything. It should route visitors to the right next step quickly.

### Service Pages (One Per Service)

Each service you offer needs its own page. "Roof Replacement" and "Roof Repair" are different services with different search intent. They need different pages.

**Structure for service pages:**

H1: Clear service name + location ("Roof Replacement in Austin, TX")

Opening paragraph: What this service is, who needs it, and why they should choose you. Skip the industry jargon.

Process section: Step-by-step breakdown of what happens when they hire you. Homeowners fear the unknown. Explain your process clearly.

Pricing guidance: You don't need exact prices. Ranges work. "$8,000-$15,000 for most Austin homes, depending on size and materials." Transparency builds trust.

Before/after gallery: Real photos of real jobs. This is the most persuasive element on any contractor page.

FAQ section: Answer the specific questions people ask about this service. This also captures featured snippet opportunities in Google.

CTA: Phone number + form. Always.

Each service page should be 800-1,500 words of genuinely useful content. Not keyword-stuffed fluff. Actual information that helps homeowners understand the service.

For [SEO implementation](/services/seo) details on service pages, that's a whole separate discipline. But the content structure above provides the foundation.

### Location Pages (Service Area Coverage)

If you serve multiple cities, each city needs its own page. "HVAC Contractor in Round Rock" is a different search than "HVAC Contractor in Austin." Google treats them as separate intents.

**What makes a location page work:**

Unique content about serving that specific area. Mention neighborhoods. Reference local landmarks or conditions. "We've been serving the Mueller development since its first homes were built" is more compelling than generic copy.

Service list specific to that location. If you offer different services or have different response times in different areas, say so.

Testimonials from customers in that area. If you have five reviews from Round Rock customers, feature them on the Round Rock page.

Local phone number if you have one. Or at minimum, mention your proximity to that area.

Avoid the temptation to create location pages by find-replacing city names. Google knows the difference between unique content and templated pages. So do visitors.

### About Page (Trust Building)

The about page isn't for you. It's for converting skeptics into customers.

**Elements that build trust:**

Founder story with real details. Not "John started XYZ Company because he saw a need in the community." More like "I started roofing in 1998 after watching my dad run his crew for twenty years. Grew up on job sites in North Austin."

Team photos with real names. Even just first names. Real photos of real people, not stock photography.

Licensing and insurance information. In Texas, roofing contractors need specific licensing. Display your license number. Show proof of insurance. This separates legitimate contractors from chuck-in-a-truck operations.

Credentials and certifications. GAF Master Elite. Carrier Factory Authorized. NATE certified. Whatever applies to your trade. These matter to homeowners even if they don't fully understand them.

Community involvement. Sponsor a Little League team? Support local charities? Mention it. Local credibility compounds.

### Contact Page

The contact page should make it insultingly easy to reach you.

**Required elements:**

Phone number (large, click-to-call enabled).

Business hours. When can they call and expect someone to answer?

Contact form. Short. Name, phone, email, brief description of what they need. Five fields maximum. Every additional field reduces form completions.

Physical address if you have a legitimate business location. If you're a service-area business operating from home, skip this.

Service area description or map. "We serve Austin and the surrounding 30 miles, including Round Rock, Cedar Park, and Georgetown."

### Reviews/Testimonials Page

Aggregating your reviews in one place serves two purposes: converting skeptical visitors and giving you a page that can rank for "[your company] reviews."

**Implementation that works:**

Pull reviews from Google, Facebook, and trade-specific platforms like Angi. Don't just screenshot them. Embed them or recreate them with clear attribution.

Organize by service type if you have enough volume. Someone researching roof replacement wants to see roofing reviews, not HVAC reviews.

Include video testimonials if you have them. Video converts better than text.

Link to your profiles on review platforms. Let visitors verify the reviews are real.

## Conversion Elements That Matter

Having the right pages isn't enough. Those pages need the right conversion elements.

### Click-to-Call Buttons

Over 70% of local searches happen on mobile devices. When someone searches "plumber near me" on their phone, they want to call. Make that stupidly easy.

**Technical implementation:**

Use tel: links for all phone numbers. \`<a href="tel:+15125551234">512-555-1234</a>\` makes the number clickable on mobile.

Place click-to-call buttons in your header (sticky on scroll), after every major content section, and in your footer. You can't have too many.

Use button styling, not just text links. Buttons get more clicks.

Test your click-to-call functionality on actual devices. I've seen sites where the tel: link was formatted wrong and nothing happened when you tapped it.

### Contact Forms (Short!)

Not everyone wants to call. Some prefer forms. But long forms kill conversion.

**Optimal form structure:**

- Name (first name is enough)
- Phone number
- Email (optional but useful)
- Brief message or dropdown for service type
- Submit button with action-oriented text ("Get My Free Quote" beats "Submit")

That's it. No address fields. No budget dropdowns. No "how did you hear about us" questions. Collect that information during the follow-up call.

Every additional form field reduces completion rates by 10-15%. A 4-field form converts dramatically better than an 8-field form.

### Chat Widgets (Pros/Cons)

Live chat can work for contractors, but it comes with tradeoffs.

**Pros:**

- Captures visitors who won't call or fill out forms
- Provides immediate engagement
- Can qualify leads before calling back

**Cons:**

- Requires someone to actually respond in real time
- Chatbots frustrate users if they're obviously not human
- Can slow down page load
- Poorly implemented chat can feel desperate or spammy

If you can commit to responding to chats within 2 minutes during business hours, add chat. If you can't, skip it. A chat widget that takes 10 minutes to respond is worse than no chat at all.

### Trust Badges and Certifications

Display these prominently, but avoid visual clutter.

**What to include:**

Review platform ratings (Google 4.8/5, etc.) with actual numbers.

Trade certifications with recognizable logos. GAF, Carrier, manufacturer partnerships.

Association memberships. BBB (if A rated), Chamber of Commerce, trade associations.

License and insurance statements. "Licensed, Bonded, and Insured" is standard but necessary.

Years in business or jobs completed. "Serving Austin since 1998" or "Over 2,000 roofs replaced."

Keep badges above the fold on the homepage. One row of 4-5 badges is better than a wall of twenty logos nobody recognizes.

## Mobile Optimization Requirements

If your website doesn't work perfectly on mobile, you're losing half your potential customers. Not an exaggeration.

### Speed Requirements

Google's threshold: pages should load in under 2.5 seconds on mobile connections. Most contractor websites fail this.

**Technical fixes that matter:**

Image optimization. Compress images aggressively. Use WebP format where possible. Lazy load images below the fold. A single unoptimized hero image can add 3+ seconds to load time.

Hosting upgrade. Cheap shared hosting can't deliver fast load times. Upgrade to a managed hosting provider or use a CDN. Budget $30-50/month, not $5/month.

Page builder bloat. If your site runs on a visual page builder (Elementor, Divi, WPBakery), it's probably loading 2MB+ of unnecessary JavaScript. Consider a cleaner theme or custom development.

Third-party script audit. Every chat widget, analytics tool, and marketing pixel adds load time. Remove anything that isn't essential. Test impact by disabling scripts one at a time.

Use Google PageSpeed Insights and Google's Core Web Vitals report to identify specific issues. Anything with a red score needs attention.

### Thumb-Friendly Design

Mobile users navigate with thumbs. Design accordingly.

**Implementation specifics:**

Touch targets (buttons, links) should be at least 44x44 pixels. Tiny links that require precise tapping frustrate users.

Primary CTAs should be reachable from the bottom half of the screen. That's where thumbs naturally rest.

Avoid horizontal scrolling. Ever. If elements overflow the screen horizontally, something's broken.

Forms should use appropriate input types. \`type="tel"\` for phone numbers brings up the numeric keypad. \`type="email"\` brings up the email keyboard. These small details reduce friction.

### Click-to-Call Prominence

On mobile, the phone number isn't just visible—it's the primary action.

**Implementation:**

Sticky header that persists as users scroll. Phone number always visible in the top corner.

Click-to-call button in the hero section. Big enough to tap easily.

"Call Now" buttons after every major content section.

Bottom navigation bar on mobile with a prominent call button. Some sites dedicate 50%+ of the bottom nav bar to the phone action.

## Technical SEO for Service Websites

[SEO](/services/seo) goes beyond keywords. For service websites, technical implementation determines whether Google can properly understand and rank your content.

### Schema Markup

Schema tells Google explicitly what your pages are about. For local service businesses, this is particularly important.

**Required schema types:**

LocalBusiness (or more specific: RoofingContractor, Plumber, HVACBusiness). Include name, address, phone, service area, hours, and aggregate rating.

Service schema for each service page. Defines what service is offered, provider, and area served.

FAQPage schema for FAQ sections. Makes your Q&As eligible for rich results in search.

Review schema if you display reviews on your site. Can trigger star ratings in search results.

Implementation: Add schema as JSON-LD in the head of each page. Test with Google's Rich Results Test before deploying.

### Page Speed Optimization

Speed affects both rankings and conversions. Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor, and slow sites directly reduce conversion rates.

**Core Web Vitals targets:**

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Under 2.5 seconds. How fast your main content loads.
- First Input Delay (FID): Under 100 milliseconds. How fast the page responds to interaction.
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Under 0.1. How much elements jump around while loading.

**Common fixes:**

Pre-load critical assets (fonts, above-fold images). Defer non-critical JavaScript. Specify image dimensions to prevent layout shift. Use a CDN for static assets.

### Core Web Vitals Compliance

Check your Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console. Google shows field data from real users, which is more accurate than lab tests.

Fix pages with "Poor" or "Needs Improvement" scores before worrying about new content or features. A fast site with average content outperforms a slow site with great content.

## Content That Converts

Beyond structure, the actual content on your pages matters for both SEO and conversion.

### Before/After Galleries

The single most persuasive content element for any contractor.

**Implementation best practices:**

Real photos from real jobs. Not stock photography.

Consistent angles. Before and after shots from the same position make transformations obvious.

Include location context when possible. "Roof replacement in Travis Heights" connects the job to a real neighborhood.

Add brief captions with project details. Material used, timeframe, any interesting challenges overcome.

Make galleries easy to browse. Lightbox functionality, clear navigation, mobile-friendly grid.

Homeowners want to see your work. Give them plenty to look at.

### Video Testimonials

Written testimonials are good. Video testimonials are better. Video proves the customer is real in a way text can't.

**Capture methodology:**

Ask happy customers at the end of successful jobs. Not every customer—just the ones who express genuine satisfaction.

Keep videos under 60 seconds. Attention spans are short.

Film horizontally on a phone. Don't stress about production quality. Authenticity matters more than polish.

Simple questions: "What was the problem?" "How did we help?" "Would you recommend us?"

Post videos on your website, YouTube, and Google Business Profile. Cross-platform presence compounds the value.

### Case Studies

For higher-ticket services (new construction, major renovations, system replacements), case studies provide depth that galleries can't.

**Case study structure:**

The problem: What was the customer's situation? What needed to be fixed or built?

The solution: What did you do? Be specific about materials, methods, and decisions made.

The result: How did it turn out? Include photos. Quote the customer if possible.

This format demonstrates your expertise while showing prospects what working with you looks like. It also creates natural opportunities for keyword optimization around specific services and locations.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

I see these constantly. Every one of them costs leads.

### Stock Photos Everywhere

Generic images of contractors with perfect teeth and spotless work boots fool nobody. They signal that you don't have real work to show.

Fix: Use actual photos from actual jobs. Phone cameras are fine. Document every project. Build your gallery over time. Even mediocre real photos outperform polished stock images.

### No Pricing Information

"Request a quote" with no pricing guidance whatsoever makes prospects assume you're expensive. Or hiding something.

Fix: Provide ranges. "Most roof replacements in our area run $10,000-$18,000 depending on size and materials. We provide free written estimates." This qualifies leads and builds trust through transparency.

### Slow Load Times

Every second over 3 seconds costs you roughly 10% of visitors. A 7-second load time means half your traffic is gone before they see anything.

Fix: Prioritize speed over aesthetics. Compress images. Upgrade hosting. Minimize plugins. Use tools like PageSpeed Insights to identify specific bottlenecks.

### Missing Service Areas

If visitors can't immediately tell whether you serve their location, they'll assume you don't and leave.

Fix: List every city and neighborhood you serve. Create location pages for your primary service areas. Include a service area map on your homepage and contact page. When someone searches "plumber in Cedar Park," they should land on a page that specifically mentions Cedar Park.

### Buried Contact Information

If finding your phone number requires scrolling or clicking through menus, you've already lost the emergency caller.

Fix: Phone number in the header. Sticky header that follows scroll. Click-to-call everywhere. Contact buttons after every section. Make it impossible to miss.

## Building a Website That Converts

Your website is a lead generation machine. Every decision—from page structure to button color—either helps or hurts that goal.

Start with the fundamentals. Fast load times. Mobile-first design. Clear calls to action. Real photos and testimonials. Then layer in the details: schema markup, [conversion optimization](/services/cro), and ongoing content that attracts search traffic.

Most contractors outsource their website to whoever's cheapest and wonder why it doesn't generate leads. The contractors who dominate their markets treat their website as a critical business asset and invest accordingly.

If your current site isn't generating 5-8% conversion rates, something's broken. Usually multiple things.

    title: 'How to Set Up Google Analytics 4 for Home Service Businesses',
    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'GA4 setup for service businesses requires tracking what actually matters: phone calls, form submissions, and quote requests. This technical guide covers event configuration, GTM implementation, conversion tracking, and building reports that show real business impact.',
    content: `
GA4 is not Universal Analytics with a new interface. It's a fundamentally different measurement model that most contractors set up wrong.

:::stat 80%
of home service leads come through phone calls and forms—yet default GA4 tracks neither of these actions
:::

The default GA4 installation tracks pageviews. Great for media companies. Useless for a plumbing company where 80% of leads come through phone calls and quote request forms.

After setting up analytics for dozens of contractors, I've seen the same pattern repeatedly: owners think they have tracking because they installed the GA4 tag. They have nothing useful. They're collecting data about scroll depth while staying completely blind to actual revenue-generating actions.

This guide covers proper GA4 setup for home service businesses. We're talking custom events, conversion tracking, call tracking integration, and reports that actually show you which marketing channels produce paying customers.

## Why GA4 Setup Matters for Service Businesses

Universal Analytics is dead. Google sunset it in July 2023. If you're still trying to access your old UA data, it's gone.

GA4 is what you have now. The question is whether you've configured it to track what matters for your business or whether you're just collecting vanity metrics.

Here's what default GA4 tracks automatically:

- Page views
- Scrolls (90% depth)
- Outbound clicks
- Site search
- Video engagement
- File downloads

:::warning
Notice what's missing? Phone calls. Form submissions. Quote requests. Chat conversations. Everything that actually generates revenue for a service business. Default GA4 is measuring the wrong things entirely.
:::

[Proper analytics setup](/services/analytics) means configuring GA4 to track the actions that correlate with revenue. Not just traffic. Traffic is a vanity metric. A contractor website getting 10,000 visitors and zero calls is worthless. A site getting 500 visitors and 40 calls is a money machine.

:::pullquote
"Traffic without conversions is just expensive window shopping." - Every contractor who learned the hard way
:::

Let's build the money machine configuration.

## Basic GA4 Setup

:::tip
Use Google Tag Manager from the start. Installing GA4 directly works, but GTM makes every subsequent step in this guide dramatically easier. The 30 minutes you spend setting up GTM saves hours later.
:::

If you haven't set up GA4 at all, start here. If you already have a basic installation, skip to the events section.

### Step 1: Create Your GA4 Property

Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com). Click Admin (gear icon, bottom left). Under Property, click Create Property.

Fill in the details:

- **Property name**: Your business name (e.g., "Smith Plumbing - Website")
- **Reporting time zone**: Your local time zone
- **Currency**: USD

Click Next. Select your industry category (most contractors fall under "Business & Industrial") and business size.

### Step 2: Create a Data Stream

A data stream is where your data comes from. For a website, you need a Web data stream.

Click Create Stream > Web. Enter:

- **Website URL**: Your full domain (e.g., smithplumbing.com)
- **Stream name**: "Website" or "Main Site"

Click Create Stream.

You'll see a Measurement ID that looks like \`G-XXXXXXXXXX\`. Copy this. You'll need it for installation.

### Step 3: Install the GA4 Tag

You have two options: direct installation or Google Tag Manager. Use GTM. Always use GTM. It makes everything else in this guide dramatically easier.

**Google Tag Manager Installation:**

If you don't have GTM, create an account at [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com). Create a container for your website.

Install the GTM container code on your site. You'll get two snippets:

\`\`\`html
<!-- Google Tag Manager - HEAD -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXXX');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
\`\`\`

This goes in the \`<head>\` section.

\`\`\`html
<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) - BODY -->
<noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX"
height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
\`\`\`

This goes immediately after the opening \`<body>\` tag.

**Adding GA4 to GTM:**

In GTM, go to Tags > New. Click Tag Configuration and select Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration.

Enter your Measurement ID (\`G-XXXXXXXXXX\`).

For triggering, select "All Pages" (or create it: Triggers > New > Page View > All Page Views).

Name it "GA4 - Configuration" and save.

Click Submit in the top right to publish your container.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Go back to GA4. In the left sidebar, click Reports > Realtime.

Open your website in another tab. You should see yourself appear in the realtime report within 30 seconds.

If you don't see activity, check:
- GTM container is published (not just saved)
- Container code is on all pages
- No ad blockers interfering
- Correct Measurement ID

## Events to Track for Service Businesses

Default enhanced measurement events are fine for content sites. For service businesses, you need custom events that track lead generation actions.


Here are the events every home service business should track:

### phone_click

When someone clicks a phone number link to call.

### form_submit

When someone submits a contact form, quote request, or any lead capture form.

### chat_start

When someone initiates a live chat conversation.

### quote_request

When someone completes a quote or estimate request. This might be the same as form_submit, or it might be a distinct action depending on your site structure.

### service_page_view

When someone views a specific service page. Useful for understanding which services generate the most interest.

### location_page_view

For multi-location businesses, tracking which location pages get views.

### cta_click

Button clicks on key calls-to-action (like "Get Free Estimate").

Let's implement each of these.

## Setting Up Custom Events in GTM

This is where most GA4 setups fall apart. People either don't set up custom events or they set them up incorrectly.

### Phone Click Tracking

Every \`tel:\` link click should fire an event. Here's the implementation:

**Step 1: Create a Trigger**

In GTM, go to Triggers > New.

- **Trigger Type**: Click - Just Links
- **This trigger fires on**: Some Link Clicks
- **Conditions**: Click URL contains \`tel:\`

Name it "Trigger - Phone Link Click" and save.

**Step 2: Create the Tag**

Go to Tags > New.

- **Tag Type**: Google Analytics: GA4 Event
- **Configuration Tag**: Select your GA4 Configuration tag
- **Event Name**: \`phone_click\`

Add event parameters to capture context:

| Parameter Name | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| phone_number | {{Click URL}} |
| page_location | {{Page URL}} |
| page_title | {{Page Title}} |

Set the trigger to "Trigger - Phone Link Click".

Name it "GA4 - Event - Phone Click" and save.

**Step 3: Test It**

Click Preview in GTM. Open your website in the debug panel. Click a phone number link. You should see the tag fire in the debug panel.

### Form Submission Tracking

Form tracking depends on how your forms work. The three most common scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Form redirects to a thank you page**

Create a trigger:
- **Trigger Type**: Page View
- **This trigger fires on**: Some Page Views
- **Conditions**: Page Path equals \`/thank-you\` (or whatever your confirmation page is)

Create the GA4 event tag with event name \`form_submit\`.

**Scenario 2: Form shows success message without redirect (AJAX submission)**

This requires a custom HTML tag to listen for form submissions. Add this tag:

\`\`\`html
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // For standard HTML forms
  document.querySelectorAll('form').forEach(function(form) {
    form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      window.dataLayer.push({
        'event': 'form_submission',
        'form_id': form.id || 'unnamed_form',
        'form_name': form.name || form.id || 'contact_form',
        'page_location': window.location.href
      });
    });
  });
});
</script>
\`\`\`

Set this tag to fire on All Pages.

Then create a trigger:
- **Trigger Type**: Custom Event
- **Event name**: \`form_submission\`

And a GA4 event tag that fires on this trigger with event name \`form_submit\`.

**Scenario 3: Third-party form tool (Gravity Forms, WPForms, HubSpot, etc.)**

Each tool has its own event. Common ones:

| Form Tool | DataLayer Event |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Gravity Forms | \`gform_confirmation_loaded\` |
| WPForms | \`wpforms_submit\` |
| Contact Form 7 | \`wpcf7mailsent\` |
| HubSpot | \`hsFormCallback\` |

Create a Custom Event trigger listening for the appropriate event, then fire your GA4 form_submit tag.

### Chat Start Tracking

Most chat widgets push events to the dataLayer. Check your chat provider's documentation.

For common providers:

**Intercom:**
\`\`\`javascript
Intercom('onShow', function() {
  window.dataLayer.push({'event': 'chat_opened'});
});
\`\`\`

**Drift:**
\`\`\`javascript
drift.on('startConversation', function() {
  window.dataLayer.push({'event': 'chat_started'});
});
\`\`\`

**LiveChat:**
\`\`\`javascript
LC_API.on_chat_started = function() {
  window.dataLayer.push({'event': 'chat_started'});
};
\`\`\`

Add these scripts via a Custom HTML tag in GTM (fire on All Pages), then create a Custom Event trigger and GA4 event tag.

### Quote Request Tracking

If you have a dedicated quote form, track it separately from general contact forms:

\`\`\`html
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  var quoteForm = document.getElementById('quote-form');
  if (quoteForm) {
    quoteForm.addEventListener('submit', function() {
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      window.dataLayer.push({
        'event': 'quote_request',
        'service_type': document.getElementById('service-select')?.value || 'not_specified'
      });
    });
  }
});
</script>
\`\`\`

This captures what service they're requesting a quote for, which helps you understand demand by service line.

### CTA Button Click Tracking

Track clicks on primary call-to-action buttons:

Create a trigger:
- **Trigger Type**: Click - All Elements
- **Conditions**: Click Classes contains \`cta-button\` (or whatever class your CTAs use)

Alternatively, use Click Text if your buttons have consistent text:
- **Conditions**: Click Text equals "Get Free Estimate"

Fire a GA4 event with event name \`cta_click\` and include the button text and page location as parameters.

## Conversion Tracking

Events become powerful when you mark them as conversions. GA4 lets you flag any event as a conversion.

Go to Admin > Events (under Data display). You'll see all events GA4 has received.

Click the toggle in the "Mark as conversion" column for:
- phone_click
- form_submit
- chat_start
- quote_request

Now these events appear in conversion reports and can be imported into Google Ads for optimization.

:::stat $100
If 20% of quote requests become jobs and your average job is $500, each quote_request conversion is worth $100. Assign this value so Google can optimize for revenue, not just lead volume.
:::

### Conversion Value

For advanced tracking, assign values to conversions. If you know your average job value by service type, you can calculate approximate conversion values.


In GTM, add an event parameter:

| Parameter Name | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| value | 100 |
| currency | USD |

GA4 will use these for revenue reporting.

## Call Tracking Integration

[Call tracking](/blog/call-tracking-setup-guide) platforms integrate with GA4 to send phone call data as events. This is critical because phone_click only tells you someone clicked to call. Call tracking tells you if they actually connected and for how long.

### CallRail Integration

In CallRail, go to Integrations > Google Analytics.

1. Connect your Google Analytics account
2. Select your GA4 property
3. Choose which events to send (at minimum: outbound calls)
4. Enable "Send events for all calls" or set up filtering

CallRail will send events like:
- \`outbound_call\` - A call was made
- \`call_answered\` - Call was answered by your team
- \`call_missed\` - Call went unanswered

These include parameters like call duration, source, campaign, and keyword (if using number pools).

### CallTrackingMetrics Integration

Similar process. Go to Integrations > Google Analytics 4. Connect your account and configure which events flow through.

### What Call Data Tells You

With call tracking integrated, you can answer:

- Which marketing channels drive calls that get answered?
- What's the average call duration by source?
- Which keywords drive the longest calls (longer calls usually = more qualified leads)?
- What's your missed call rate by time of day?

This data is gold for [measuring marketing ROI](/blog/marketing-roi-measurement). You can finally connect ad spend to phone conversations, not just clicks.

## Building Useful Reports

GA4's default reports are generic. Build custom reports that answer your specific business questions.

### Exploration Reports

Go to Explore > Free Form. This is where real analysis happens.

**Report 1: Lead Sources**

Create a report showing conversions by source:

- **Rows**: Session source / medium
- **Values**: Add each conversion event (phone_click, form_submit, etc.)

This shows you exactly where leads come from.

**Report 2: Service Page Performance**

- **Rows**: Page path
- **Filters**: Page path contains "/services/"
- **Values**: Views, average engagement time, conversions

See which service pages attract traffic and which convert.

**Report 3: Geographic Performance**

- **Rows**: City
- **Values**: Sessions, conversions, conversion rate

Understand which cities in your service area generate the most qualified traffic.

### Custom Reports

In Reports > Library, you can create saved reports for regular review.

Build a weekly leads report:
- Conversions by channel
- Week-over-week comparison
- Top converting pages

Build a monthly performance report:
- Total leads by type
- Cost per lead (requires Google Ads connection)
- Conversion rate trends

## Connecting to Google Ads

If you're running Google Ads, connecting GA4 lets you import conversion data for campaign optimization.

### Link Your Accounts

Go to Admin > Product Links > Google Ads Links. Click Link and select your Google Ads account.

Enable:
- Enable Google Ads personalization
- Enable auto-tagging

### Import Conversions

In Google Ads, go to Tools & Settings > Conversions > New conversion action > Import > Google Analytics 4.

Select the conversions you want to import (phone_click, form_submit, quote_request).

Set counting preference:
- **One per ad click**: For lead gen (prevents one user submitting multiple forms from counting as multiple conversions)
- **Every**: For e-commerce or if each submission is valuable

### Why This Matters

Once conversions are imported, Google Ads can optimize for actual leads, not just clicks. You can use:

- **Target CPA bidding**: Set a target cost per form submission
- **Maximize conversions**: Let Google optimize for more leads within your budget

This dramatically improves ad performance. Instead of getting lots of cheap clicks that never convert, you get fewer clicks that are more likely to become customers.

## Common Setup Mistakes

After auditing dozens of contractor GA4 setups, these mistakes appear constantly:

:::warning
These six mistakes are costing contractors thousands in wasted ad spend every month. I've seen companies spending $8,000/month on Google Ads with zero conversion data flowing back. They had no idea which campaigns worked.
:::

### Mistake 1: Not Tracking Phone Calls at All

About 60-70% of home service leads come through phone calls. If you're only tracking form submissions, you're missing most of your conversion data.

Fix: Implement phone_click tracking at minimum. Integrate with a call tracking platform for complete data.

### Mistake 2: Double-Counting Conversions

If your form submits and redirects to a thank-you page, and you're tracking both the form submission event AND the thank-you pageview as conversions, you're counting each lead twice.

Fix: Pick one trigger per conversion. Usually the form submission is more reliable.

### Mistake 3: Not Filtering Internal Traffic

Your own team visiting the website skews data. Set up internal traffic filtering.

In GA4, go to Admin > Data Streams > [Your stream] > Configure tag settings > Define internal traffic. Add your office IP address.

Then go to Admin > Data Settings > Data Filters. Create a filter to exclude internal traffic.

### Mistake 4: Using Default Channel Groupings

GA4's default channel groupings are okay, but they miss nuance. Traffic from your Google Business Profile shows up as "Organic Search," same as regular Google search results.

Fix: Use UTM parameters consistently. Tag your GBP links, email links, and any other sources you want to track separately. Create custom channel groupings for more granular analysis.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Debug Mode

Publishing GTM changes without testing leads to broken tracking. Always use Preview mode before publishing.

In GTM, click Preview. A debug window opens connected to your site. Perform the actions you're tracking. Verify tags fire correctly. Only then publish.

### Mistake 6: Not Setting Up Conversion Imports

GA4 data is only useful if it flows to your advertising platforms. If Google Ads can't see your conversions, it can't optimize for them.

Fix: Complete the Google Ads connection. Import all relevant conversions. Let campaigns optimize for leads, not clicks.

## GA4 Maintenance

Setup isn't one-and-done. Schedule regular maintenance:

**Weekly:**
- Check Realtime reports to confirm data is flowing
- Review conversion counts for anomalies

**Monthly:**
- Review source/medium report for new sources
- Check event counts for unexpected drops
- Verify Google Ads conversion imports are current

**Quarterly:**
- Audit all events to ensure they're still firing correctly
- Test forms and phone links to confirm tracking works
- Review and update any custom reports

## Making Data Actionable

Raw data is useless. The point of all this setup is making better marketing decisions.

:::tip
Schedule 30 minutes every Monday morning to review your GA4 conversion data. Which channels produced leads last week? Which pages are converting? This weekly habit turns analytics from a dusty dashboard into an active decision-making tool.
:::

Questions your GA4 should answer:

1. **Which marketing channels generate the most leads?** Allocate budget accordingly.

2. **Which service pages have high traffic but low conversions?** Those need optimization.

3. **What time of day do most conversions happen?** Schedule ads and staff appropriately.

4. **Which cities in your service area generate the most leads?** Target those areas more heavily.

5. **What's your cost per lead by channel?** Kill the expensive channels, scale the efficient ones.

    excerpt: 'Attribution is harder for lead generation than e-commerce. Offline conversions, phone calls, and long sales cycles break most tracking. Here is what actually works for service businesses.',
    content: `
Attribution tracking was built for e-commerce. Someone clicks an ad, lands on a product page, adds to cart, checks out. Clean transaction. Clear path. The sale happens in one session on one device with a credit card charge that proves exactly when revenue occurred.

Lead generation breaks all of that.

:::stat $12,000
A homeowner sees your Google Ad on Tuesday. Visits your site but does not convert. Googles you again Thursday from work. Checks reviews Saturday. Mentions you to their spouse. Calls Monday from an unknown number. The job closes three weeks later for $12,000. Which touchpoint gets credit?
:::

A homeowner sees your Google Ad on Tuesday. Visits your site but doesn't convert. Googles you again on Thursday from their work computer. Looks at reviews on their phone Saturday morning. Mentions your company to their spouse. Calls Monday from a number you don't recognize. Books an appointment. The job closes three weeks later for $12,000.

Which touchpoint gets credit for that revenue? The ad they clicked? The review site? The spouse who validated the decision? The phone call that actually booked the appointment?

This is the attribution problem for lead generation. And most businesses get it wrong because they apply e-commerce logic to a fundamentally different customer journey.

## Why Attribution Is Harder for Lead Gen

Three factors make lead gen attribution uniquely difficult compared to online sales.

### Offline Conversions

When someone buys a product online, the transaction happens in your tracking system. When someone calls your office and books an appointment, the transaction happens outside your tracking system entirely.

That phone call is your conversion event. But Google Analytics doesn't know about it. Google Ads doesn't know about it. Your website analytics show a session that looks like a bounce because the visitor called instead of filling out a form.

:::warning
Without connecting offline conversions back to your tracking, you are missing 40-70% of the picture for most service businesses. Your data shows which channels drive website traffic. It does not show which channels drive revenue.
:::

### Phone Calls

Phone calls are the primary conversion action for most service businesses. A study by Invoca found that 68% of consumers prefer to contact businesses by phone for urgent issues.

But phone calls are attribution black holes.

When someone calls the number on your website, you don't automatically know:
- Which marketing channel brought them to your site
- Which keyword they searched (if they came from ads)
- Which page they were viewing when they decided to call
- Whether they'd visited before
- What their customer journey looked like

Without [proper call tracking](/blog/call-tracking-setup-guide), every phone call is "direct traffic" in your attribution model. You know you're getting calls. You don't know why.

### Long Sales Cycles

E-commerce attribution windows are measured in hours or days. Someone sees an ad and buys within the same week, often the same session.

Lead gen attribution windows are measured in weeks or months. A roofing job might have a three-month journey from first touch to closed contract. A kitchen remodel could take six months from initial research to deposit.

Standard attribution windows don't accommodate this. Google Ads' default conversion window is 30 days. If your sales cycle is 45 days, you're systematically underreporting conversions for every channel.

Worse, the longer the journey, the more touchpoints exist, and the more complex the attribution question becomes.

## Attribution Models Explained

An attribution model is a rule that determines how credit for conversions gets distributed across touchpoints. Every model makes tradeoffs.

### Last Click Attribution

The conversion goes to whatever touchpoint happened immediately before the conversion.

**How it works:** Customer sees Facebook ad on Day 1, clicks Google Ad on Day 7, fills out a form. Google Ads gets 100% of the credit.

**Good for:** Understanding what closes deals. Identifying which channels convert ready-to-buy prospects.

**Bad for:** Valuing awareness channels. Understanding how customers discover you initially.

**The reality:** This is what most businesses use by default, often without realizing it. If your only conversion tracking is in Google Ads, you're running last-click attribution whether you intended to or not.

### First Click Attribution

The conversion goes to whatever touchpoint introduced the customer to your business.

**How it works:** Customer sees Facebook ad on Day 1, clicks Google Ad on Day 7, fills out a form. Facebook gets 100% of the credit.

**Good for:** Understanding demand generation. Identifying which channels drive awareness.

**Bad for:** Understanding what actually converts. A channel that introduces customers who never buy gets full credit for nothing.

**The reality:** Almost nobody runs first-click attribution deliberately. It's theoretically interesting but practically difficult to implement accurately.

### Linear Attribution

Credit gets split equally across all touchpoints.

**How it works:** Customer has five touchpoints before converting. Each touchpoint gets 20% credit.

**Good for:** Acknowledging that the full journey matters. Avoiding over-crediting single touchpoints.

**Bad for:** Precision. Treating a casual organic visit the same as a high-intent branded search doesn't match reality.

**The reality:** Linear is better than single-touch models but too simplistic for meaningful optimization. You can't make decisions based on everything being equal.

### Time Decay Attribution

Credit gets weighted toward touchpoints closer to the conversion. Earlier touchpoints get less credit.

**How it works:** Touchpoints in the final week get 50% of credit. Touchpoints in weeks 2-3 get 30%. Earlier touchpoints get 20%.

**Good for:** Lead gen specifically. Acknowledges that recent touchpoints influenced the decision more directly while still crediting earlier ones.

**Bad for:** Awareness optimization. Systematically undervalues channels that introduce prospects early in long journeys.

:::tip
For most home service businesses, time decay attribution is the sweet spot. It is simple enough to implement, accurate enough to make decisions, and does not require enterprise-level data volume.
:::

**The reality:** Time decay is often the most practical multi-touch model for lead gen. It's imperfect but makes reasonable assumptions about influence.

### Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution

First and last touchpoints get most of the credit (typically 40% each). Middle touchpoints split the remainder.

**How it works:** Customer has five touchpoints. First touchpoint gets 40%. Last touchpoint gets 40%. The three middle touchpoints split 20%.

**Good for:** Balancing awareness and conversion. Acknowledging that introduction and closing both matter significantly.

**Bad for:** Nurture optimization. If your middle-journey content is driving decisions, position-based won't reveal that.

**The reality:** Position-based is popular in B2B where both demand generation and sales enablement matter. For simpler lead gen, it may overcomplicate without adding clarity.

### Data-Driven Attribution

Machine learning analyzes your actual conversion data and calculates how much each touchpoint contributed to conversion likelihood.

**How it works:** Algorithm compares converting and non-converting paths. Identifies which touchpoints statistically increase conversion probability.

**Good for:** Accuracy at scale. Eliminating human bias about which channels should get credit.

**Bad for:** Small sample sizes. You need significant conversion volume for statistical validity. Google requires 600 conversions in 30 days minimum.

**The reality:** Data-driven is the gold standard but requires scale most small businesses don't have. If you're getting 50 leads a month, data-driven attribution won't work reliably.

## The Phone Call Problem

Phone calls deserve their own section because they break attribution so comprehensively.

:::stat 100%
A visitor from your best Google Ad spends 2 minutes browsing, then calls. Analytics records a 100% bounce rate. Zero conversions. The session looks like a failure—but they just booked a $15,000 job.
:::

A visitor lands on your website from a Google Ad. They browse for two minutes. They call the number displayed on the page. The call lasts eight minutes. They book an appointment.

What does Google Analytics record? A 2-minute session with a 100% bounce rate. No conversion event. The session looks like a failure.

What does Google Ads see? A click that didn't convert. Negative signal for smart bidding.

What actually happened? A qualified lead that converted into a paying customer.

:::warning
Without call tracking, your data actively lies to you. Your best-performing channels look like they are failing because their conversions happen offline. You cannot optimize what you cannot measure.
:::

### Implementing Call Tracking

[Call tracking](/blog/call-tracking-setup-guide) uses dynamic number insertion (DNI) to assign unique phone numbers to different traffic sources.

Here's the basic architecture:

1. Visitor arrives on your site from Google Ads
2. JavaScript detects the traffic source via UTM parameters or gclid
3. The phone number displayed on your site swaps to a tracking number
4. Visitor calls the tracking number
5. Call tracking platform records the call and its source
6. Data flows back to GA4 and Google Ads as a conversion

For keyword-level tracking, you need number pools. Instead of one tracking number, you have 15-20 numbers assigned to individual sessions. When a visitor calls, you know not just that they came from Google Ads, but which keyword they searched.

Cost for basic call tracking runs $45-100/month depending on call volume and feature needs. That investment pays for itself immediately by making your channel attribution accurate.

## Practical Attribution for Small Businesses

Enterprise attribution models don't translate to small businesses. A company getting 30 leads per month can't run data-driven attribution meaningfully.

Here's what actually works:

### Minimum Viable Attribution Stack

:::stat $45-150/mo
The cost of basic call tracking that connects phone leads to marketing sources. This single investment typically pays for itself within the first week by revealing which channels actually produce jobs.
:::

**Google Analytics 4:** Tracks all website activity and sources. Free.

**Google Ads conversion tracking:** Tracks form submissions and phone calls from paid campaigns. Free with Google Ads spend.

**Call tracking platform:** Connects phone calls to marketing sources. $45-150/month.

**CRM with source tracking:** Records lead source at the contact level. Salesforce, HubSpot, or even a spreadsheet.

This stack gives you:
- Which channels drive website traffic (GA4)
- Which ads drive form submissions (Google Ads)
- Which sources drive phone calls (call tracking)
- Which leads close and at what value (CRM)


### The "Good Enough" Model

For most lead gen businesses, last-touch with call tracking is good enough.

Credit the conversion to whatever channel immediately preceded the form submission or phone call. Don't overthink the awareness touchpoints you can't measure anyway.

Is this perfect? No. You're probably undervaluing awareness channels like SEO and over-crediting channels like branded search.

Does it work? Yes. You can make meaningful optimization decisions. You know whether Google Ads is producing leads. You know if your SEO investment is generating calls. You have data instead of guesses.

Perfect attribution is a fantasy. Functional attribution is achievable.

## Setting Up Attribution Tracking

Let's get technical.

### GA4 Configuration

GA4 handles attribution differently than Universal Analytics. The default model is data-driven, but it falls back to paid-and-organic last-click for accounts without enough conversion data.

Key settings to configure:

**Attribution settings:** Admin > Attribution settings. Set your lookback window to match your sales cycle. For home services, 60-90 days is usually appropriate.

**Reporting attribution model:** Set your default reporting model. Last click or time decay work for most lead gen businesses.

**Conversion events:** Mark your actual conversions as conversion events, not just page views. Form submissions, phone clicks, and chat initiations at minimum.

For detailed GA4 setup instructions specific to service businesses, see our [GA4 setup guide](/blog/ga4-setup-home-services).

### Google Ads Conversion Tracking

Google Ads conversion tracking connects your ad spend to actual results.

**Primary conversion actions:**

Form submissions: Install the conversion tag to fire on your thank-you page or form submission event.

Phone calls from ads: Use call extensions with conversion tracking enabled.

Phone calls from website: Import your call tracking data or use Google's website call tracking.

**Enhanced conversions:** Enable enhanced conversions to improve attribution accuracy. This matches first-party data (like email addresses from form submissions) with Google's logged-in user data.

**Offline conversion import:** For closed-loop attribution, import your CRM data back into Google Ads. When a lead closes, you upload that conversion with its value so Google Ads knows the actual outcome.

More on this in the offline conversion section below.

### CRM Integration

Your CRM is where attribution becomes meaningful. Website tracking tells you about sessions. Your CRM tells you about customers.

**Source capture at lead creation:**

Every form submission should capture and store:
- utm_source
- utm_medium
- utm_campaign
- utm_content (optional)
- gclid (Google Click ID, if present)
- Referring URL

Most CRMs support this through hidden form fields. HubSpot does this automatically. Salesforce requires custom fields and form configuration.

**Phone call source capture:**

Your call tracking platform logs the source. That data needs to flow into your CRM when the call creates a lead record.

CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics, and WhatConverts all integrate with major CRMs. Configure the integration to populate your source fields.

## UTM Parameters Done Right

UTM parameters are the foundation of marketing attribution. They're also the most commonly screwed-up part of attribution tracking.

### The Five UTM Parameters

**utm_source:** The specific platform. "google", "facebook", "yelp", "direct_mail"

**utm_medium:** The marketing channel type. "cpc", "organic", "referral", "email"

**utm_campaign:** The specific campaign. "spring_ac_promo", "roof_replacement_2026", "brand_awareness"

**utm_content:** Differentiates similar links. "ad_variant_a", "homepage_hero", "footer_link"

**utm_term:** The keyword (primarily for paid search). Auto-populated by Google Ads with auto-tagging enabled.

### UTM Best Practices

**Use lowercase consistently.** UTMs are case-sensitive. "Google" and "google" create separate buckets in your reports. Pick lowercase and stick with it.

**Create a documented convention.** Write down your UTM structure. Share it with anyone who creates marketing links. Consistency matters more than perfection.

**Don't use UTMs for internal links.** UTMs on internal links overwrite the original source attribution. Someone arrives via Google Ads, clicks an internal link with UTMs, and now they show as coming from your internal campaign.

**Use a spreadsheet or URL builder.** Manual UTM creation leads to typos and inconsistency. Google's Campaign URL Builder works for basic needs. A shared spreadsheet with formulas works for teams.

Example naming convention:
\`\`\`
utm_source: platform name (google, facebook, yelp, email)
utm_medium: channel type (cpc, organic, social, referral, email)
utm_campaign: descriptive-name-with-date (spring-promo-2026-q2)
\`\`\`

### Auto-Tagging vs Manual UTMs

Google Ads can auto-tag clicks with a gclid parameter. This provides more accurate tracking than manual UTMs and enables features like audience building.

**Recommendation:** Use auto-tagging for Google Ads. Use manual UTMs for everything else.

If you need both (rare), enable "Allow manual tagging to override auto-tagging" in GA4.

## Offline Conversion Tracking

This is where lead gen attribution gets real. Tracking website activity is easy. Tracking closed revenue is hard.


### The Closed-Loop Process

1. Visitor arrives on site with trackable parameters
2. Visitor converts (form or call) with source data captured
3. Lead enters CRM with source data attached
4. Sales process happens (could take weeks/months)
5. Lead closes or is marked lost
6. Outcome data is pushed back to advertising platforms

That final step is what most businesses skip. And it's the most important part.

### Google Ads Offline Conversion Import

Google Ads can accept uploaded conversions. When you tell Google Ads that a click from February resulted in a $15,000 job in April, the algorithm gets smarter about which clicks lead to valuable customers.

**Setup requirements:**

1. Enable offline conversion tracking in Google Ads
2. Capture gclid on all form submissions
3. Store gclid in your CRM at lead creation
4. Export closed leads with gclid, conversion date, and value
5. Upload via CSV, Google Sheets sync, or API

**Upload timing matters.** Google recommends uploading offline conversions within 90 days of the click. Stale uploads don't help Smart Bidding optimize.

**Minimum volume requirements:** You need at least 30 conversions per 30 days for Google's algorithm to meaningfully incorporate offline data.

### CRM-to-Ads Integration

For ongoing automation, connect your CRM directly to Google Ads.

**HubSpot:** Native integration available. Closed deals in HubSpot can sync automatically to Google Ads as conversions.

**Salesforce:** Use the Salesforce-Google Ads integration. Opportunity close events sync as conversions.

**Other CRMs:** Zapier or custom API integration. Trigger a conversion upload when a deal closes.

[The detailed measurement setup](/blog/marketing-roi-measurement) for connecting CRM data to advertising platforms could fill its own guide. The principle is simple: connect your revenue data to your advertising data.

## When Attribution Doesn't Matter

Attribution obsession can be counterproductive. Sometimes the answer is "who cares?"

### Small Budget Reality

If you're spending $2,000/month on marketing across two channels, sophisticated attribution won't change your decisions meaningfully.

You're running Google Ads and investing in SEO. You know both produce leads. Does it matter precisely whether Google Ads is 60% of revenue or 70%? You're not going to stop doing SEO either way.

Attribution precision becomes valuable when you're making meaningful reallocation decisions. If your budget is small and your channels are few, directional accuracy is sufficient.

### Brand Searches

Someone searches your company name and calls you. What gets the credit?

Technically, branded search gets last-touch credit. But branded search didn't create demand. It captured demand that something else created.

Don't optimize for branded search attribution. Optimize for the non-branded channels that drive people to search your brand name in the first place.

### Referrals and Word-of-Mouth

Your best customer source might be impossible to track. A neighbor recommends you. A family member vouches for your work. Someone sees your truck in a driveway.

These touchpoints will never show up in your attribution model. The customer will arrive as "direct traffic" or maybe a branded search if they google you before calling.

Accept that some of your business comes from unmeasurable sources. That doesn't mean you shouldn't measure what you can.

## Attribution Reporting

Data without reporting is useless. You need regular visibility into what's working.

### Weekly Lead Source Report

Every week, look at:

- Total leads by source (form + phone combined)
- Cost per lead by paid channel
- Lead volume trends vs previous weeks

This takes 15 minutes and answers the basic question: is anything broken?

### Monthly Channel Performance

Monthly, go deeper:

- Revenue by source (from your CRM)
- Return on ad spend by campaign
- Conversion rate by landing page
- Call tracking source breakdown

This answers: where should we invest next month?

### Quarterly Attribution Review

Every quarter, audit your attribution setup:

- Are tracking tags still firing correctly?
- Has anything been untagged or misconfigured?
- Are your UTM conventions being followed?
- Is CRM data syncing properly?

[Building dashboards](/blog/marketing-dashboard-service-companies) that automate this reporting saves hours of manual data pulling.

## The Honest Truth About Attribution

Here's what nobody marketing attribution software wants to tell you: perfect attribution doesn't exist.

:::pullquote
"The goal is not perfect attribution. The goal is attribution accurate enough to make better decisions than you are making today."
:::

Every model makes assumptions. Every tracking system has gaps. Every customer journey includes unmeasurable touchpoints.

A customer might see your yard sign, google you later, read reviews, see a retargeting ad, call from a different phone, and book an appointment. Your tracking might capture two of those five touchpoints if you're lucky.

That's okay.

The goal isn't perfect attribution. The goal is attribution that's accurate enough to make better decisions than you're making today.

If you currently have no idea which channels produce customers, basic tracking gives you massive improvement. If you're already tracking sources, connecting offline conversions gives you the next improvement. If you're already doing that, multi-touch models might refine things further.

Diminishing returns hit fast. Going from 0% tracking to 60% tracking is transformative. Going from 80% tracking to 85% tracking rarely changes decisions.

### What Actually Matters

For most lead gen businesses, here's what moves the needle:

1. **Track phone calls.** Most of your conversions happen on the phone. [Set up call tracking](/blog/call-tracking-setup-guide) or stay blind.

2. **Connect your CRM.** Attribution to closed revenue beats attribution to leads. Know what actually produces customers.

3. **Set realistic windows.** Match your attribution lookback to your actual sales cycle. A 7-day window for a business with 60-day sales cycles is useless.

4. **Accept imperfection.** Some customers will be untraceable. Some attribution will be wrong. Make decisions with the data you have.

5. **Focus on big wins.** Optimizing the difference between 25% and 28% attribution is less valuable than discovering a channel producing leads you didn't know about.

Attribution is a means to an end. The end is spending money on marketing that works and stopping spending money on marketing that doesn't.

If your attribution system helps you make those decisions, it's working. If you're chasing attribution accuracy for its own sake, you're optimizing the wrong thing.

You spend $5,000/month on Google Ads. Leads are coming in. But can you tell me how many became paying customers? If you cannot answer this question with real data, you are flying blind.
:::

This is the reality for most home service businesses. Marketing lives in one system. Sales lives in another. Operations lives in a third. And nobody can tell you whether that $5,000 produced $50,000 in revenue or $5,000 in revenue.

CRM integration fixes this. Not by adding another tool, but by connecting the tools you already have so data flows from ad click to closed job automatically.

This is not a CRM comparison guide. This is how to wire your systems together so you actually know what is working.

## Why CRM Integration Matters More Than CRM Choice

Every contractor asks the same question: which CRM should I use?

:::warning
Wrong question. A perfectly chosen CRM that does not talk to your website forms, your call tracking, or your ad platforms is useless for measuring marketing ROI. A mediocre CRM with proper integrations tells you exactly which marketing channels produce revenue.
:::

The right question: how do I connect my CRM to everything else so I can track the full customer journey?

Here is what proper integration looks like:

1. Someone clicks your Google Ad
2. They land on your website (with tracking parameters preserved)
3. They fill out a form or call your tracking number
4. Lead automatically appears in your CRM with source attribution
5. Your team works the lead through stages
6. When the job closes, revenue data syncs back to your ad platform
7. Google Ads now knows this keyword produced a $15,000 job

## CRM Options for Contractors

Quick overview of what is actually worth considering. I am not going to pretend these are all equal.

### Go High Level ($97-297/month)

All-in-one platform. CRM, marketing automation, call tracking, landing pages, email, SMS, review requests, pipeline management.

The integration advantage: everything is native. No Zapier. No middleware. Build a workflow that captures a lead, sends a text, waits for response, assigns a task, and triggers a review request after the job. All in one place.

The disadvantage: steep learning curve. The interface is not intuitive. You will spend weeks configuring it properly.

Best for: companies with someone dedicated to systems, or those who hire it out.

### ServiceTitan (enterprise pricing)

The enterprise choice for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. Deep field service management, dispatching, inventory, memberships, and marketing automation built for trades.

The integration advantage: native integrations with major ad platforms, call tracking built in, and marketing scorecard that tracks calls to jobs.

The disadvantage: expensive. Complex. Overkill for companies under $2M revenue. Implementation takes months.

Best for: established companies ready to professionalize their operations.

### Jobber ($49-199/month)

Purpose-built for field service. Scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, payments, and basic CRM in a clean interface.

The integration advantage: simple. Works well for what it does. Integrates with QuickBooks natively.

The disadvantage: marketing automation is limited. You will need external tools for sophisticated lead nurturing. API access on higher tiers only.

Best for: companies that want something that works out of the box without customization.

### Housecall Pro ($49-149/month)

Similar to Jobber. Scheduling, dispatching, estimates, invoicing, and payments.

The integration advantage: decent Zapier connectivity, native QuickBooks integration, and a marketplace of add-ons.

The disadvantage: same as Jobber. Marketing automation requires external tools.

Best for: companies who prioritize operational simplicity over marketing sophistication.

### HubSpot (free-$800+/month)

General-purpose CRM with strong marketing automation capabilities.

The integration advantage: exceptional API, hundreds of native integrations, and robust marketing features even on free tier.

The disadvantage: not built for field service. No scheduling, dispatching, or job management. You need a separate field service tool.

Best for: companies who want marketing sophistication and are willing to use separate tools for operations.

## Essential Integrations

Regardless of which CRM you choose, these integrations are non-negotiable for connecting marketing to revenue.


### Website Forms to CRM

When someone fills out a form on your website, that lead must appear in your CRM automatically with source data attached.

**The data that must transfer:**
- Contact info (name, phone, email)
- What they need (service type, problem description)
- How they found you (UTM parameters, referrer, landing page)
- When they submitted (timestamp for speed-to-lead tracking)

:::tip
That hidden field for UTM parameters is critical. Your forms must capture UTM parameters from the URL and include them in the submission. Otherwise you know a lead came in but not which campaign drove them.
:::

**Technical implementation options:**

**Option 1: Native form integration**

Most CRMs offer embeddable forms or landing page builders. The form lives in your CRM, you embed it on your site, and leads flow directly.

Advantage: no configuration required. Disadvantage: limited design control, may not match your site.

**Option 2: Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat)**

Your website form tool (Gravity Forms, Typeform, Jotform) triggers a Zap that creates a contact in your CRM.

This is the configuration I use for most Gravity Forms to Go High Level connections:

Trigger: New Gravity Forms submission
Action: Create/Update GHL Contact
Field mapping:
- Name field to First Name + Last Name
- Phone field to Phone
- Email field to Email
- Service dropdown to Custom Field (service_requested)
- UTM Source (hidden field) to Custom Field (lead_source)
- UTM Medium (hidden field) to Custom Field (lead_medium)
- UTM Campaign (hidden field) to Custom Field (lead_campaign)

That hidden field part is critical. Your forms must capture UTM parameters from the URL and include them in the submission. Otherwise you know a lead came in but not which campaign drove them.

**Option 3: Webhooks**

For full control, configure your form to POST directly to your CRM's API endpoint.

This is the approach I take for clients who need speed and reliability. No third-party dependency, no Zapier limits, instant delivery.

Example webhook payload for a contact form:

\`\`\`json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "phone": "+15125551234",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "customField": {
    "service_requested": "AC Repair",
    "lead_source": "google",
    "lead_medium": "cpc",
    "lead_campaign": "austin-hvac-summer"
  },
  "source": "website_form",
  "tags": ["hot_lead", "ac_repair"]
}
\`\`\`

Your CRM receives this, creates the contact, applies the tags, and triggers whatever automation you have set up. Speed-to-lead sequences start immediately.

### Call Tracking to CRM

Phone calls drive most home service leads. If calls do not make it into your CRM with source attribution, you are flying blind.

**What call tracking integration should capture:**
- Caller phone number
- Call timestamp
- Call duration
- Call recording (for quality and training)
- Traffic source that drove the call
- Landing page they were on before calling
- Keyword they searched (if from paid search)

**Platform-specific integration patterns:**

**CallRail to Go High Level:**
Native integration. Enable it in CallRail settings, authorize GHL, and calls automatically create contacts with source data.

**CallRail to Jobber:**
Use Zapier. Trigger on "call completed," action creates Jobber customer with notes containing call details.

**CallRail to HubSpot:**
Native integration available. Calls create timeline events and can trigger workflows.

**CallTrackingMetrics to any CRM:**
Webhook notifications on call events. Configure to POST to your CRM API or Zapier webhook.

The configuration that matters most: ensuring the tracking source follows the call. Dynamic number insertion on your website captures the visitor's original traffic source (Google Ads, organic, Facebook, etc.) and attaches it to the call. Without this, you just know calls are happening but not which marketing drove them.

### Google Ads Integration

Connecting your CRM to Google Ads enables offline conversion tracking. This is the difference between optimizing for clicks and optimizing for revenue.

:::stat $12,000
Google Ads records a click (GCLID). That GCLID follows the user to your website. When they convert, the GCLID gets stored with their contact record. When that contact becomes a paying customer, you send the GCLID back to Google: this click led to a $12,000 job.
:::

**What offline conversion tracking does:**

Google Ads records a click (GCLID). That GCLID follows the user to your website. When they convert (form or call), the GCLID gets stored with their contact record. When that contact becomes a paying customer, you send the GCLID back to Google along with the conversion value.

With enough data, Google's algorithm optimizes for revenue, not leads. It learns which keywords, audiences, and placements produce customers who actually pay.

**Implementation approaches:**

**Direct API integration (most reliable):**

When a deal closes in your CRM, fire a webhook to Google's Offline Conversion API:

\`\`\`
POST /upload_click_conversions
{
  "gclid": "stored_gclid_from_lead",
  "conversion_action": "closed_job",
  "conversion_value": 12000,
  "currency_code": "USD"
}
\`\`\`

This requires development work but gives you full control and reliability.

**Zapier-based integration:**

Trigger: CRM deal stage changed to "Closed Won"
Action: Google Ads Offline Conversion
Configuration: Map deal ID to GCLID lookup, deal value to conversion value

Works but introduces Zapier as a dependency and potential failure point.

**Google Ads native import:**

For HubSpot and Salesforce, Google offers native integrations that pull conversion data directly from your CRM. The setup is simpler but you lose some flexibility.

### Email Marketing Integration

Your CRM contacts should sync to your email marketing platform for newsletters and campaigns. Most CRMs have basic email built in, but dedicated email platforms (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit) have better deliverability and more sophisticated automation.

The integration pattern: bidirectional sync. New contacts in CRM appear in email platform. Unsubscribes in email platform update CRM. Engagement data (opens, clicks) flows back to CRM for lead scoring.

For [proper analytics setup](/services/analytics), email engagement data enriches your understanding of which leads are worth pursuing.

## Setting Up Website Form Integration

Let me walk through the technical setup for a common scenario: Gravity Forms on WordPress feeding leads to Go High Level.

**Step 1: Enable webhooks in Gravity Forms**

Install the Gravity Forms Webhooks add-on. This lets you send form data to any URL when a submission occurs.

**Step 2: Get your GHL API endpoint**

In Go High Level, go to Settings > Business Profile > API. Copy your location ID. Your webhook URL will be:

\`\`\`
https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/contacts/
\`\`\`

With header: \`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\`

**Step 3: Configure the webhook in Gravity Forms**

Edit your form. Go to Settings > Webhooks > Add New.

Request URL: your GHL endpoint
Request Method: POST
Request Format: JSON
Request Headers: Authorization with your bearer token

Field mapping:
- firstName: map to your Name field (first name)
- lastName: map to your Name field (last name)
- phone: map to your Phone field
- email: map to your Email field
- customField.service_requested: map to your Service dropdown
- customField.utm_source: map to your hidden UTM source field
- tags: can be static ("website_lead") or dynamic based on form

**Step 4: Capture UTM parameters**

Add hidden fields to your form for utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign. Use JavaScript to populate these from URL parameters:

\`\`\`javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const utmSource = document.querySelector('input[name="input_X"]'); // hidden field
  const utmMedium = document.querySelector('input[name="input_Y"]');
  const utmCampaign = document.querySelector('input[name="input_Z"]');

  if (utmSource) utmSource.value = params.get('utm_source') || 'direct';
  if (utmMedium) utmMedium.value = params.get('utm_medium') || 'none';
  if (utmCampaign) utmCampaign.value = params.get('utm_campaign') || 'none';
});
\`\`\`

**Step 5: Test the integration**

Submit a test form with UTM parameters in the URL. Verify the contact appears in GHL with correct source attribution.

For clients on our [marketing automation services](/blog/marketing-automation-small-business), we set up fallback tracking so even if UTM capture fails, referrer data is preserved.

## Call Tracking to CRM Setup

Call tracking integration follows a similar pattern but requires handling the call tracking platform as the data source.

**CallRail to Go High Level (native):**

1. In CallRail, go to Settings > Integrations > Go High Level
2. Authorize the connection with your GHL API key
3. Configure which call events to sync (all calls, first-time callers only, calls over X duration)
4. Map CallRail tracking source to GHL custom field

Once configured, every tracked call creates a GHL contact with:
- Caller info
- Call recording link
- Source tracking (which marketing channel)
- Call tags based on your CallRail configuration

**CallRail to other CRMs via Zapier:**

Trigger: CallRail - New Call (or Completed Call)
Action: Your CRM - Create Contact

Map fields:
- Caller phone to CRM phone field
- Tracking source to CRM source field
- Call recording URL to CRM notes field
- Call duration to CRM custom field (useful for lead scoring)

**Pro tip:** Only sync calls over 30 seconds. Shorter calls are usually hangups or wrong numbers. This keeps your CRM clean.

## Closed-Loop Reporting Setup

:::warning
This is where most contractors give up. It is also where the real competitive advantage lives. The companies that implement closed-loop reporting can outbid competitors for every click because they know exactly which clicks produce revenue.
:::

Closed-loop reporting means: when a job closes, that revenue data flows back to your marketing platforms so they can optimize for actual money, not vanity metrics.

**The data flow:**

1. Marketing drives a lead (Google Ads, Facebook, organic)
2. Lead enters CRM with source attribution preserved
3. Lead progresses through sales pipeline
4. Lead becomes a customer with a dollar value attached
5. Dollar value and source data sync back to marketing platforms
6. Marketing platforms now optimize for revenue

**Implementation for Google Ads:**

You need to capture and store the GCLID. This is the click ID that Google attaches to every ad click.

In your landing page, capture the GCLID from the URL:

\`\`\`javascript
const gclid = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('gclid');
\`\`\`

Store it in a hidden form field. When the lead submits, the GCLID travels with their contact data to your CRM.

When the deal closes, push the conversion back to Google:

Via Zapier:
- Trigger: CRM deal stage = Closed Won
- Action: Google Ads Upload Offline Conversion
- Map: GCLID field, deal value, conversion action name

Via direct API:
\`\`\`
POST https://googleads.googleapis.com/v15/customers/{customer_id}:uploadClickConversions

{
  "conversions": [{
    "gclid": "{stored_gclid}",
    "conversion_action": "customers/{customer_id}/conversionActions/{action_id}",
    "conversion_date_time": "2026-01-25 09:15:00-05:00",
    "conversion_value": 12500.00,
    "currency_code": "USD"
  }]
}
\`\`\`

**Implementation for Facebook:**

Similar concept with the fbclid and Facebook's Conversions API.

Capture fbclid from URL. Store with contact. When deal closes, send to Facebook:

\`\`\`
POST https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{pixel_id}/events

{
  "data": [{
    "event_name": "Purchase",
    "event_time": timestamp,
    "user_data": {
      "em": [hashed_email],
      "ph": [hashed_phone],
      "fbc": "{stored_fbclid}"
    },
    "custom_data": {
      "value": 12500.00,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }]
}
\`\`\`

This is advanced. If it seems like a lot, [that is what we do](/contact).

## Marketing Attribution in Your CRM

Once integrations are flowing, you need to make the data visible and actionable.

**Essential reports to build:**

**Lead source performance:**
How many leads came from each source (Google Ads, Facebook, organic, referral)? What is the cost per lead by source?

**Source to close rate:**
Which sources produce leads that actually close? A source with cheaper leads that never close is worse than expensive leads that convert.

**Revenue by source:**
The ultimate metric. Which channels produce actual dollars? This requires closed-loop tracking.

**Time to close by source:**
Do Google Ads leads close faster than organic leads? This affects cash flow and lifetime value calculations.

**Most CRMs have reporting dashboards. The key is ensuring source data is captured consistently so reports are accurate.**

If your CRM lacks robust reporting, export data to Google Sheets or a BI tool. The [marketing ROI measurement framework](/blog/marketing-roi-measurement) I wrote covers the analytical approach in depth.

## Automation Triggers from CRM

With data flowing into your CRM, you can trigger automations based on contact behavior and pipeline changes.

**High-value automations:**

**Stage change notifications:**
When a lead moves to "Estimate Scheduled," notify the sales rep via SMS. When it moves to "Proposal Sent," start a follow-up sequence.

**Lead scoring alerts:**
If a contact opens 5 emails, visits the pricing page, and requests a callback, alert the sales team immediately. This lead is hot.

**Re-engagement campaigns:**
Leads that stall in "Quote Sent" for 7 days get an automated follow-up sequence. Not generic "just checking in" but value-add content addressing common objections.

**Win-back automation:**
Contacts who received an estimate but went cold get a campaign after 30 days: "We noticed your [service] project might still need attention."

**Review requests on close:**
When deal stage hits "Completed," wait 4 hours, then trigger review request via SMS and email. Automated but feels personal.

These automations run in the background. Your team focuses on conversations, not task management.

## Common Integration Mistakes

I have debugged dozens of broken CRM integrations. These are the patterns I see repeatedly.

:::tip
Before going live with any integration, send 5 test submissions through the complete flow. Verify data appears correctly in every connected system. This 15-minute check prevents weeks of bad data.
:::

### Mistake 1: Not Capturing Source Data

Leads flow into the CRM but without attribution. You know you got 100 leads this month but not which marketing produced them.

The fix: audit your form and call tracking configurations. Every contact entry point needs to capture and pass source data.

### Mistake 2: Overwriting Data on Updates

A contact fills out two forms. The second submission overwrites the original source data. Now you think they came from organic when they actually came from a $50 Google Ads click.

The fix: configure integrations to preserve original source data. Update additional fields but never overwrite attribution fields on existing contacts.

### Mistake 3: Duplicate Contacts

Same person enters the system multiple times through different channels. You now have three contacts for John Smith with fragmented data.

The fix: use phone or email as the unique identifier. Configure integrations to update existing contacts rather than create new ones when a match exists.

### Mistake 4: No Error Handling

Webhook fails. Zapier errors out. Integration breaks. Nobody notices for two weeks. Leads are lost.

The fix: set up monitoring. Zapier has error notifications. Webhooks can log to a monitoring service. Check integration health weekly.

### Mistake 5: Over-Engineering

Building 47 Zaps before you have a basic system working. Adding complexity before you have proven the simple version works.

The fix: start with one integration. Website forms to CRM. Get that bulletproof. Then add call tracking. Then add closed-loop reporting. Layer complexity gradually.

## The Integration Stack I Recommend

For most contractors doing $500K-$3M revenue, here is the integration stack that balances power and simplicity:

:::stat $200-500/mo
Total cost for a fully integrated system that tracks marketing to revenue. Compare that to the $5,000/month you might be wasting on marketing you cannot measure.
:::

**CRM:** Go High Level ($97-297/month) or HubSpot Free + Jobber

**Call tracking:** CallRail ($45-95/month)

**Form integration:** Direct webhook from website forms or Zapier

**Closed-loop reporting:** Zapier triggers from CRM to Google/Facebook Ads

**Email:** Native in GHL, or Mailchimp/ActiveCampaign if using HubSpot

**Integration glue:** Zapier ($20-50/month) or Make ($9-16/month)


## Getting This Right

CRM integration is not a weekend project. It requires:

1. Choosing the right tools for your business size and complexity
2. Configuring integrations correctly the first time
3. Testing every data flow before going live
4. Monitoring for failures over time
5. Iterating as your business evolves

We covered the technical foundations here. The [home services marketing guide](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide) provides broader context on marketing strategy. For [analytics implementation](/services/analytics), that is its own discipline.

If you want help building an integrated marketing and CRM stack that actually tells you what is working, [we do this](/contact). We build the systems that connect marketing to revenue for home service businesses.

The goal is not data for data's sake. It is knowing which marketing dollars come back multiplied and which disappear into the void.

    date: '2026-01-26',
    excerpt: 'Most contractor lead gen advice is written by people who have never closed a roofing job. Here are 12 methods that actually fill your calendar, ranked by what works versus what sounds good.',
    content: `
Most lead generation advice for contractors is written by marketers who have never given an estimate, never dealt with a no-show, and never lost a job to a lowballer.

You can tell because they recommend "leveraging social media synergies" instead of telling you which platforms actually produce phone calls.

I build marketing systems for home service companies. I see the data. I know which lead sources produce $15,000 jobs and which ones produce price shoppers who ghost after the first call.

:::stat $15,000+
The average difference in job value between leads from owned sources (SEO, referrals) versus rented lead platforms. Owned lead sources also close at 2-3x the rate.
:::
This is what actually works.

## The Lead Gen Landscape: Owned vs. Rented

Before diving into tactics, understand the fundamental split in lead generation.

**Owned lead sources** are assets you control. Your website. Your Google Business Profile. Your email list. Your reputation. These compound over time. The work you do today pays dividends for years.

**Rented lead sources** are platforms where you pay for access. Angi. Thumbtack. Facebook ads. You stop paying, the leads stop coming. No equity built.

The contractors who struggle are 100% dependent on rented leads. The ones who thrive use rented sources strategically while building owned assets.

Your goal: shift the ratio toward owned sources over time. Use paid channels to generate cash flow while investing in assets that reduce your cost per lead every year.

## 12 Proven Lead Generation Methods

### 1. Google Business Profile Optimization

This is the highest-ROI lead generation activity for most local contractors. Free to set up. Free to maintain. Generates calls directly.

**What actually moves the needle:**

Complete every single field. Google rewards completeness. Business description, services, service areas, hours, attributes. All of it.


:::stat 520%
Businesses with 100+ photos get 520% more calls than businesses with fewer than 10. Post job photos weekly. Before and after shots. Team photos. Equipment.
:::
Reviews are the ranking factor. More reviews, higher rankings, more calls. But quality matters too. Detailed reviews mentioning specific services help you rank for those terms.

**The technical detail most miss:** Your primary category selection affects which searches you appear for. A "Roofing Contractor" ranks differently than a "Roofer." Test both. See which produces more impressions in your market.

Post weekly updates. Google rewards active profiles. Takes 5 minutes. Share a recent project, a tip, or a seasonal reminder.

For a deeper dive on local search optimization, see our [complete SEO strategy guide](/services/seo).

### 2. Local SEO (Your Website Ranking)

Your website should rank for "[service] + [city]" searches. "Plumber in Austin." "HVAC repair Dallas." These searches indicate someone ready to hire.

**The pages you need:**

One dedicated page per service per major city you serve. Not a generic services page. A specific page for "Water Heater Installation in [City]" with relevant content, local signals, and clear calls to action.

These pages should include your service area, pricing context, process explanation, and social proof. They should load fast, work on mobile, and have your phone number prominent.

**The technical foundation:**

Schema markup tells Google exactly what your business does and where. LocalBusiness schema, Service schema, Review schema. Most contractor websites have none of this.

Internal linking connects your pages in ways that help Google understand your site structure. Your homepage should link to service pages. Service pages should link to location pages. Everything should connect logically.

Page speed affects rankings. If your site takes 5 seconds to load on mobile, you are losing rankings and losing visitors. Compress images. Minimize code. Use proper hosting.

### 3. Google Ads (Pay-Per-Click)

Google Ads puts you at the top of search results immediately. You pay per click. Works fast but requires ongoing management.

**Where contractors waste money:**

Broad keywords. Bidding on "plumber" when you mean "emergency plumber [city]" burns budget on irrelevant searches.

Poor landing pages. Sending ad traffic to your homepage instead of a dedicated landing page matching the search intent.

No negative keywords. Showing ads for "plumber jobs" or "plumber salary" or "DIY plumbing" wastes clicks.

**What works:**

Start narrow. Exact match keywords for your highest-margin services in your most profitable areas. Expand only after you are profitable.

Dedicated landing pages for each ad group. Someone searching "water heater replacement" should land on a page about water heater replacement, not your homepage.

Call tracking so you know which keywords produce actual phone calls, not just clicks.

For contractors, we typically see cost per lead between $50-200 depending on service type and market competition. High-ticket services like roofing or HVAC replacement justify higher costs. Commodity services need tighter management.

We cover paid advertising strategy in depth in our [advertising services guide](/services/paid-advertising).

### 4. Local Service Ads (Google Guaranteed)

Local Service Ads appear above regular Google Ads. You pay per lead, not per click. The "Google Guaranteed" badge builds trust.

**The reality check:**

Lead quality varies wildly by market and service type. Some contractors get great leads. Others get tire-kickers who submitted requests to five companies.

You cannot control when you appear. Google decides based on proximity, reviews, responsiveness, and budget. Less control than regular Google Ads.

Disputes for bad leads are hit or miss. Google will refund some, reject others. Budget for a percentage of leads being worthless.

**Making it work:**

Fast response time is everything. Contractors who respond within 5 minutes book more jobs. Google tracks this and rewards it with more visibility.

Review volume and quality affect your rankings. Push for Google reviews specifically, not just Yelp or Facebook.

Set your budget based on how many leads you can actually handle. Turning off LSA during busy periods protects your responsiveness score.

### 5. Referral Programs (Systematic, Not Hopeful)


:::stat 50-70%
Referrals close at 50-70% versus 10-20% for cold leads. They spend more. They complain less. Every contractor knows this. Yet most contractors have no system for generating referrals.
:::
Yet most contractors have no system for generating referrals. They hope customers refer them. Hope is not a strategy.

**A system that works:**

Ask at the right moment. Right after completing a job while satisfaction is high. Not two weeks later via email.

Make it easy. Provide business cards, a referral link, or a text they can forward. Remove friction.

Incentivize both sides. Offer the referrer something meaningful. A gift card, a discount on future work, a cash bonus. Offer the new customer something too.

Track religiously. Know which customers refer. Know which incentives work. Double down on what produces results.

**The math:**


### 6. Strategic Partnerships

Other businesses serve your customers before they need you. Partner with them.

**High-value partnerships for contractors:**

Real estate agents send you clients who just bought homes and need inspections, repairs, or upgrades.

Insurance adjusters work with homeowners who have claims for storm damage, water damage, or fire restoration.

Property managers need reliable contractors for tenant turnover, maintenance, and emergencies.

Interior designers partner on renovation projects where they handle design and you handle execution.

**Making partnerships work:**

Provide value first. Send them referrals before expecting any in return.

Make it easy to refer you. Give them materials. Return their calls immediately. Make them look good.

Stay top of mind. Check in quarterly. Send updates. Do not let them forget you exist.

Formal agreements help. A referral fee structure creates accountability on both sides.

### 7. Direct Mail (Targeted, Not Batch-and-Blast)

Yes, direct mail still works. But not the way most contractors use it.

**What does not work:**

EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail) to random neighborhoods. You are paying to reach renters, new homeowners, and people who will never need your services.

Generic postcards with no specific offer or urgency.

**What works:**

Targeted lists based on home value, home age, homeownership status, and time in residence. Reach homeowners with 20-year-old roofs, not everyone in a zip code.

Specific offers with deadlines. "15% off AC tune-up, book by March 15" beats "Call us for all your HVAC needs."

Repetition. People need to see your mailer 3-7 times before they act. One mailing does almost nothing.

**Cost reality:**

Targeted mail costs $0.75-$1.50 per piece when done right. Response rates of 1-2% are realistic. Run the math on your average job value to see if it makes sense for your business.

### 8. Door Hangers After Jobs

You just completed a job at 123 Main Street. The neighbors watched your truck, heard the work, saw the result.

Capitalize on this.

**The simple system:**

Carry door hangers in your truck. After every job, hang them on 20-50 neighboring doors.

The message: "We just completed a [service] for your neighbor at [address]. Here is a special offer for the neighborhood."

Include a limited-time discount or priority scheduling. Make it feel exclusive.

**Why it works:**


:::tip
Carry door hangers in every work truck. After every job, have your team hang them on 20-50 neighboring doors. This costs almost nothing and produces some of the highest-quality leads you will get.
:::

Social proof. The neighbors saw you working. They know someone on their street chose you.

Relevance. If one home on the street needs a new roof, others probably do too. Same age homes, same weather exposure.

Trust transfer. You are not a random company from the internet. You are "the contractor who did the Johnson's roof."

This costs almost nothing and produces some of the highest-quality leads you will get.

### 9. Nextdoor

Nextdoor is a social network organized by neighborhood. Homeowners ask for contractor recommendations constantly.

**The free approach:**

Claim your business page. Keep it updated. Respond when someone mentions your company.

Monitor your service area for posts asking for recommendations. You cannot self-promote in response, but happy customers can recommend you.

**The paid approach:**

Nextdoor offers local advertising. Target by neighborhood. Reach verified homeowners in specific areas.

Results vary by market. Some contractors see great ROI. Others find the audience too small to scale.

**The reputation reality:**

Nextdoor users are vocal. One bad experience gets shared with the entire neighborhood. This makes quality and follow-through non-negotiable. But if you do good work, recommendations spread organically.

### 10. Facebook Ads for Retargeting

Facebook ads for cold audiences rarely work for contractors. The targeting is broad. The intent is low. People scrolling Facebook are not thinking about their HVAC system.

But Facebook retargeting is different.

**The strategy:**

Install the Facebook pixel on your website. It tracks visitors.

Create an ad that shows only to people who already visited your site. They searched for you, clicked on your link, looked at your services. They know you exist.

Retargeting ads remind them to take action. "Still need that AC repair? Schedule today and get $50 off."

**Why this works:**

Website visitors who do not convert are not lost forever. They got distracted, decided to get other quotes, or just forgot. Retargeting brings them back at a fraction of the cost of acquiring a new visitor.

Typical retargeting costs: $0.50-$2.00 per click, often 10-20% of cold audience costs.

Combine with a limited-time offer to create urgency and you have an efficient conversion machine.

### 11. Email to Past Customers

Your past customer list is a gold mine most contractors ignore completely.

These people already hired you. They trust you. They just need a reason to hire you again.

**Automated sequences that work:**

Maintenance reminders. "It has been 12 months since your AC tune-up. Time to schedule."

Seasonal preparation. "Winter is coming. Here is how to prepare your home" plus a relevant service offer.

Referral requests. Periodic reminders that you appreciate referrals and reward them.

Anniversary follow-ups. "We installed your water heater 5 years ago. Here is what to watch for and when to consider replacement."

**Tools:**

Simple email platforms like Mailchimp handle basic automation. More sophisticated options like Go High Level offer text, email, and voice automation combined.

The key: set it up once, let it run forever. The ROI compounds as your customer list grows.

For more on marketing automation, check out our [marketing automation guide for service businesses](/blog/marketing-automation-small-business).

### 12. Review Generation (Leads You Do Not Have to Pay For)

Reviews are not just reputation management. They are lead generation.

More reviews means higher Google rankings. Higher rankings means more calls. Better reviews means higher conversion rates when people do call.

**The review generation system:**

Ask every customer. Make it part of your job completion process.

Make it easy. Send a direct link to your Google review page via text. Do not make them search for you.

Time it right. Ask within 24 hours of job completion while satisfaction is fresh.

Follow up once. If they did not leave a review, one polite reminder is appropriate. More than that is annoying.

**Responding to reviews:**

Reply to every review. Positive ones get a thank you. Negative ones get a professional, solution-oriented response.

Google confirms that responding to reviews influences rankings. It also shows potential customers that you care about feedback.

## Lead Sources to Approach Carefully

Not every lead source deserves your time and money. Some are traps.

### Angi and HomeAdvisor

These platforms can work, but understand the model.

You are paying for shared leads. Multiple contractors get the same lead. You are competing on price and response speed with companies who might be desperate for work.

Lead quality varies wildly. Some are ready to hire. Many are price shopping or just "exploring options" with no urgency.


:::warning
The cost per lead on Angi/HomeAdvisor has increased steadily while quality has declined. Many contractors report paying $50-100 per lead with close rates under 10%. Run the math: at $75/lead and 8% close rate, you are paying $937 per acquired customer.
:::
**If you use them:**

Respond within minutes, not hours. Speed is your only advantage on a shared lead.

Track your close rate religiously. If you are below 15%, the math probably does not work.

Treat it as supplementary, not primary. Do not build your business on a platform that can change terms anytime.

### Thumbtack

Similar dynamics to Angi. Pay-per-lead model, shared leads, price-focused customers.

Thumbtack tends to attract more price-sensitive customers. Good for filling slow periods. Bad for building a premium brand.

### Generic Lead Generation Services

Cold call sellers promising "exclusive leads in your area" are usually aggregating form fills from random websites and selling them to multiple contractors despite calling them "exclusive."

Before signing any contract:

Ask where the leads come from. Vague answers are a red flag.

Demand a trial period with no long-term commitment.

Track results independently. Do not trust their reporting.

## Not All Leads Are Equal: Qualification Matters

A lead is not a lead is not a lead.

The contractor who generates 50 leads and closes 10 jobs outperforms the one who generates 100 leads and closes 8. Volume without quality is expensive and exhausting.

**Qualifying questions that matter:**

Timeline. When do they want the work done? "Someday" is not a lead. "This month" is.

Budget awareness. Have they researched costs? Are they prepared for realistic pricing?

Decision-making authority. Are you talking to the homeowner or a renter asking for their landlord?

Property ownership. For large jobs, confirm they own the property.

Other quotes. How many other contractors are they talking to? If it is five, they are price shopping.

**Pre-qualifying on your website:**

Your contact forms can gather qualifying information before you spend time on a call. Ask about project timeline, property type, approximate budget range.

This filters out some tire-kickers before they waste your time.

## Lead Follow-Up That Actually Converts

Getting leads is half the battle. Converting them is the other half.

And most contractors are terrible at follow-up.

### Speed to Lead Matters

Research from multiple sources shows the same thing: responding within 5 minutes dramatically increases conversion.

After 30 minutes, your chances of qualifying a lead drop by 21x compared to immediate response.

:::stat 21x
Your chances of qualifying a lead drop by 21x after 30 minutes compared to immediate response. Yet most contractors respond in hours, sometimes days. If that is you, you are losing jobs before you even compete on quality or price.
:::
Yet most contractors respond in hours, sometimes days. If that is you, you are losing jobs before you even compete on quality or price.

**The fix:**

Automated immediate response. The second a lead comes in, they get a text and an email acknowledging receipt and setting expectations.

Real-time alerts to whoever handles sales. Push notifications, not just email that might sit unopened.

A commitment to fast outreach during business hours. Five minutes means five minutes.

### Follow-Up Sequences Work

Most leads do not convert on the first contact. Life happens. They get busy. They get other quotes. They forget.

A structured follow-up sequence keeps you in consideration without being annoying.

**A sequence that works:**

Day 1: Immediate response plus first call attempt.

Day 1 (later): If no answer, text message.

Day 2: Second call attempt, follow-up email with helpful content.

Day 3: Text check-in.

Day 7: Final call attempt, email with offer or urgency.

After that, move them to a long-term nurture sequence with monthly touchpoints.

**The mindset shift:**


:::pullquote
"This is not pestering. This is professional sales follow-up. Customers expect it. The contractors who do it win more business. The ones who give up after one attempt lose to competitors with better systems."
:::
## Measuring Lead Generation ROI

You cannot improve what you do not measure.

Yet most contractors have no idea which lead sources actually produce profitable jobs. They might know their total ad spend. They rarely know cost per booked job by source.

**The metrics that matter:**

Cost per lead by source. What does it actually cost to get a phone call or form fill from each channel?

Lead to appointment rate by source. What percentage of leads become estimates?

Appointment to close rate by source. What percentage of estimates become jobs?

Average job value by source. Do certain sources produce bigger jobs?

**Calculating true cost per acquisition:**

If Google Ads costs $2,000/month and produces 40 leads, your cost per lead is $50.

If 50% of those leads schedule estimates (20 estimates), your cost per estimate is $100.

If you close 40% of estimates (8 jobs), your cost per job is $250.

If your average job is $3,000, you are spending $250 to make $3,000. That math works.

Now do this for every lead source. You might discover that a source you thought was expensive is actually your best ROI channel, or vice versa.

We cover tracking and measurement in detail in our [analytics guide](/services/analytics) and [home services marketing guide](/blog/home-services-marketing-guide).

## Building a Lead Generation System

Individual tactics are not enough. You need a system.

A system means documented processes that run without your constant attention. Automated follow-up. Tracking in a CRM. Regular analysis of what is working.

**The minimum viable system:**

1. CRM that captures every lead with source attribution.
2. Automated immediate response to every lead.
3. Follow-up sequences that run automatically.
4. Monthly review of metrics by source.
5. Quarterly reallocation of budget based on performance.


## What To Do Next

Do not try to implement all 12 methods at once.

Pick two or three that match your current situation. If you have zero Google reviews, start there. If your website is terrible, fix that first. If you have cash flow but no time, invest in paid advertising.

Build systems around what works before adding new tactics.


:::tip
Start with just two lead sources: Google Business Profile optimization (free, high ROI) and one paid channel (Google Ads or LSAs). Master those before adding complexity. Most contractors spread too thin across too many tactics.

And remember: the goal is not more leads. The goal is more profitable jobs with customers who value your work and refer their friends.

That comes from being strategic about where your leads come from and ruthless about measuring what actually works.

## FAQ

### What is the fastest way to get contractor leads?

Google Ads and Local Service Ads can generate leads within days. But fast is not always best. Fast leads from paid sources cost money and stop when you stop paying. The best long-term approach combines paid advertising for immediate cash flow with SEO and referral systems that compound over time.

### How much should contractors spend on lead generation?

Most successful contractors invest 5-10% of revenue in marketing. For a company doing $1M in revenue, that is $50,000-$100,000 annually. Start smaller if needed, but track ROI carefully. The goal is to find channels where you spend $1 and get $3+ back in profit.

### Are Angi and HomeAdvisor worth it for contractors?

They can be worth it if you have excellent response time, a competitive close rate, and you track ROI carefully. For many contractors, the cost per acquired job is too high compared to owned lead sources like SEO and referrals. Use them to supplement, not as your primary lead source.

### How do I get more referrals as a contractor?

Ask systematically. Every completed job should include a referral ask at the moment of highest satisfaction. Offer incentives to both the referrer and the new customer. Track who refers and thank them meaningfully. Most contractors hope for referrals rather than creating a system to generate them.

### What is the best CRM for contractor lead management?

For most contractors doing $500K-$5M, Jobber or Housecall Pro handle the basics well. For more sophisticated marketing automation, Go High Level offers email, SMS, and pipeline management in one platform. The best CRM is the one you actually use consistently.

### How quickly should contractors respond to leads?

Within 5 minutes during business hours. Research shows that leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to become customers than those contacted after 30 minutes. Set up automated immediate responses and real-time notifications to hit this benchmark.
